/**
 * GET /api/v1/academics/students/history?studentId=<uuid>
 *
 * R-6's second half: everything the school knows about one child, across
 * every year they were here. The master plan calls this "the STU-… ten years
 * later requirement made visible".
 *
 * ── The history is not stored anywhere; it is read ──────────────────────
 * `enrolments` has carried one row per student per academic year since
 * migration 003 — section, roll, status, the dates it started and ended. That
 * IS the history. R-6 adds no `student_history` table and denormalises
 * nothing, because a second copy of the truth is a second thing to get wrong
 * during a rollover, and rollover already writes these rows (R-3).
 *
 * So the timeline is a read of four years of `enrolments`, ordered by the
 * academic year's start date, and the current year is whichever row says
 * `status = 'active'` rather than whichever row is newest. A child who left
 * in June has a latest row and no current one, and the UI must be able to
 * tell those apart — §6 of the brief — so the flag is computed here and not
 * inferred from the array position.
 *
 * ── Why one response and not eight ──────────────────────────────────────
 * §15: search returns a compact list, opening a student loads the detail.
 * That is the split that matters. Within the detail, eight tabs firing eight
 * requests would put a spinner on every tab of a page whose whole purpose is
 * to be read end to end, and the queries are all sub-millisecond index seeks
 * against the same student id. `ward.ts` made the same call for the same
 * reason and its comment says so.
 *
 * ── Authorization, and where it is tighter than RLS ─────────────────────
 * Visibility of the CHILD is `app.can_see_student`, the existing predicate:
 * a guardian reaches their wards, a student themselves, a teacher their own
 * sections, management everyone. If it returns false the response is 404, not
 * 403 — an id that is invisible must be indistinguishable from an id that
 * does not exist, or the endpoint tells a teacher which codes are real.
 *
 * Visibility of the TABS is narrower in one place. `invoice_scope` (migration
 * 010) reads `has_role(principal, owner, accountant) OR
 * can_see_student(student_id)`, so RLS alone would show a class teacher the
 * fee balance of every child in their section. A class teacher has no reason
 * to know which families are behind on fees, and R-5 established that the
 * fix for "RLS is right for its own table and too broad for this surface" is
 * a narrower gate at the endpoint. `MAY_SEE_FEES` is that gate.
