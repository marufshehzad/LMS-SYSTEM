/**
 * GET /api/v1/ops/audit — the institution's own change history, read-only
 *
 * R-3 completion pass, the last of its three gaps. Migration 041 made
 * `audit.activity_log` readable by management and R-3's mutations began
 * writing to it; nothing displayed it. F-1603's screen.
 *
 * ── Read-only means read-only ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * GET is the only method. 010 revokes UPDATE and DELETE from the application
 * role and 041 deliberately did not restore them, so there is no write path
 * to expose even if somebody added one here. A trail its subject can edit is
 * decoration.
 *
 * ── Who may read it ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `activity_read_scope` (041) admits principal, school_owner and it_admin.
 * requireRole mirrors it. A class teacher browsing the institution's change
 * history is a different product: they would see every user creation, every
 * fee-permission change, every promotion, for children who are not theirs.
 *
 * ── Redaction, and why there is not much to redact ──────────────────────
 * The `before_state` / `after_state` blobs are written by
 * server-core/audit.ts, whose contract is already "small diffs, never PII" —
 * the enrolment move logs student IDS, not names, for exactly this reason.
 * But a contract is not a guarantee against a future caller, so this endpoint
 * masks defensively on the way OUT: any key that looks like a phone, an email,
 * a national ID or a credential is replaced with '•••'. Masking at read time
 * rather than write time is deliberate — the log keeps what happened, and the
 * screen shows what a reader is allowed to see.
 *
 * A phone number is masked to its last two digits rather than removed
 * entirely, because "the number was changed to one ending 47" is what makes
 * an audit entry useful to the person checking it.
