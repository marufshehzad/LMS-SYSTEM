 * simply never executed — that is how the §10.3 screen shipped untested, and
 * how 13 server test files across four services sat un-run because those

 * superusers from it — FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY does not change that. Run
 * these as a superuser and the tenant-isolation tests fail with "tenant B's
 * session cannot reach tenant A's section", which reads as a catastrophic
 * product bug and is in fact a wrong connection string. The preflight below

// ── Two Windows faults this script was itself blind to ──────────────────
//
// 1. `npm` is npm.cmd there, and execFileSync does not use a shell, so
//    spawning "npm" fails with ENOENT (and Node ≥20 refuses .cmd without a
//    shell outright, EINVAL). Every workspace reported FAIL with no output:
//    eleven identical failures and not one error message, which reads as
//    "the repo is broken" rather than "the runner cannot find npm".
//
// 2. Worse, and quieter. The workspace scripts said
//    `node --test 'test/*.test.ts'`. A POSIX shell strips those quotes; cmd
//    passes them through literally, no file matches, and node exits 0 having
//    run nothing. On Windows the entire suite reported success while running
//    zero tests — precisely the invisible-tests failure this file exists to
//    prevent, in this file's own tooling. They are now double-quoted, which
//    both shells strip and node globs for itself.
//
// The second fault hid for so long because "ok" and "ok" look the same: a
// workspace that ran 153 tests and one that ran none both printed a tick.
// The reporting below now says "0 tests — NOTHING RAN" instead, which is
// legitimate for the DB-backed suites when DATABASE_URL is unset and is a
// bug in every other case. It is not a hard error precisely because of that
// first case; it is simply impossible to mistake for a pass.

// nothing runs", and for twenty-six files it was doing exactly what it was
// written to prevent. db/tests/*.sql is not a workspace, has no package.json,
// and so was never in the loop above. It ran only in
// .github/workflows/database.yml.
//
// The cost was measured. `app.set_guardian_permissions` broke when migration
// 050 replaced the unique index it upserts through. Three of these suites
// caught it immediately and correctly. Nobody heard them: P5, P6, P7, P8 and
// a full project audit each declared the test suite green on the strength of
// this script, and every one of those statements was true about the Node
// tests and silent about the SQL. The fix landed as migration 064, four
// phases late. See docs/PHASE_LOG.md.
//
// These need the OWNER role on a direct connection — each file opens with
// `GRANT shikhon_app TO CURRENT_USER; SET ROLE shikhon_app`, which the
// runtime role cannot do. That is the same credential migrate.sh wants, so
// it reads the same variable.
