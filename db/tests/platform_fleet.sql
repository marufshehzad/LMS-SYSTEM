-- Migration 076 replaced the console's quadratic fleet read with set-based
-- functions, and in doing so wrote the tenant-access rule down a SECOND
-- time. `app.tenant_access(uuid)` still runs on every tenant request and has
-- to stay a single-row lookup; `app.platform_fleet_ranked()` computes the
-- same answer for the whole fleet at once. Two implementations of one rule
-- is exactly the shape this project keeps finding drifted months later.
--
-- So this suite's first and most important job is to make drift impossible
-- to ship: for EVERY tenant, the two must agree on access, ops_state and
-- billing_state. If somebody edits one CASE and not the other, this fails.
--
-- It also pins the things a paginated list gets wrong quietly — a total that
-- counts the page instead of the result, a sort that orders numbers as text,
-- a second page that repeats a row from the first, and a summary that counts
-- only as far as the page cap.

-- ── This suite brings its own fleet ────────────────────────────────────
--
-- It used to assert against whatever tenants the database happened to hold,
-- which passed on a development machine with 262 of them and FAILED on CI,
-- where the database is freshly migrated and holds none: `platform_fleet`
-- returns no rows on an empty fleet, so `SELECT DISTINCT total_count INTO`
-- left a NULL, and NULL IS DISTINCT FROM 0 raised assertion 2. Green
-- locally, red on every push since 2026-08-31.
--
-- The deeper problem was not the NULL. A suite that pins the behaviour of a
-- PAGINATED list cannot say anything at all against zero rows: with no
-- tenants, "the total describes the result, not the page" is vacuously true
-- and so is every ordering and paging assertion below. It would have gone on
-- reporting success while proving nothing.
--
-- So it seeds seven schools — more than the five-row page size used below,
-- which is what makes a total that counts the page distinguishable from one
-- that counts the fleet — and does it the way the rest of db/tests does:
-- inside a transaction that is rolled back, so the suite is idempotent and
-- leaves no residue. `database.yml` asserts exactly that after re-running
-- every suite.
--
-- Seeded through `app.create_tenant` rather than a direct INSERT, because
-- that is what the console calls and it is what writes `tenant_operations`;
-- a hand-inserted tenant would exercise a shape the product never produces.
