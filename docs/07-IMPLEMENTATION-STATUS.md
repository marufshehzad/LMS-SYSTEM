# 07 — Implementation Status: Blueprint vs. As-Built

Documents 01–06 are the design blueprint. This document is the reconciliation: what is
actually in the repository today, where the implementation deliberately diverges from the
blueprint, how to operate it, and what remains.

**Last reconciled 2026-09-02, at the end of P8** (complete — see the status
board), under D17.

## P13 production readiness (2026-09-10)

**NO-GO for production; every repository-side requirement met.** See
`docs/P13-PRODUCTION-READINESS-REPORT.md`.

| capability | code | delivery |
|---|---|---|
| Subdomain routing | **PASS** — 16 hostname shapes, full lifecycle, forged Host ignored | gated off until DNS + TLS |
| Backup / restore | **PASS** — drill run: 27 tables, 16 tenants, RTO 5.9s | backup *schedule* external |
| Env / secrets | **PASS** — 5 undocumented runtime vars closed + guard test | production values external |
| Push | **PASS** — 48 tests, whole lifecycle | **BLOCKED** — no VAPID keys, never delivered |
| SMS | **PASS** — 79 tests, allowlist, throws if named-but-unconfigured | **BLOCKED** — no aggregator |
| Cron / workers | **PASS** — three systemd timers | needs `systemctl enable` |
| Monitoring | **PASS** — readiness endpoint, 11 checks | **BLOCKED** — no `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` |

The pilot journey was **not run**: no real pilot institution exists (B-5) and
the infrastructure it would run on does not exist yet. It was not simulated.

## P12 audit status (2026-09-10)

Audited against the running system - see `docs/P12-FINAL-AUDIT-REPORT.md`.
**~93% complete for pilot; production deployability blocked on infrastructure,
not on code.** Thirteen of sixteen areas implemented and verified; three carry
work external to this repository.

| Area | Verified live | Rests on the suite | Outstanding |
|---|---|---|---|
| Platform console, guardian/student access, tenant isolation, commercial lifecycle, UI/UX across 24 routes | yes | - | - |
| Exams, fees, routine generation, import/export, sync idempotency | - | 2,270 tests, 13/13 workspaces | - |
| A4 print on paper, real SMS delivery | - | - | needs a printer and a contract |

**All five P12 minor defects were fixed on 2026-09-10.** P12-1 became one shared
`formatAcademicYear()` applied at 15 render sites across 11 files (the audit had
found 4); P12-2 routed `#/students` through the shared `pageHeader()`; P12-3 was
traced past the tab-bar symptom to `.btn-secondary` carrying a layout margin and
fixed at the cause, verified at 320/375/390/430px; P12-4 turned out to be a wrong
finding hiding a worse one — the rollback runbook globbed `*.down.sql` and would
have skipped 27 of 75 files; P12-5 removed five stale tenants, 21 → 16.

Two new guards ship with them: `academic-year-numerals.test.ts` and
`heading-hierarchy.test.ts`, both with negative controls. Suite is now **2,279
tests**, 13/13 workspaces, 28 SQL suites. See BACKLOG and PHASE_LOG.

## 1. Current state at a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Production URL** | `https://sikhon.systems/` — live since 2026-08-31, Let's Encrypt cert valid through 2026-11-29 |
| **Hosting (as-built)** | Hostinger KVM2 VPS `voltix-prod`, Ubuntu 24.04 · one Node process (`deploy/server.mjs`) under systemd on `172.16.1.1:4100` · **Caddy** terminates TLS and already serves five sibling applications. **The blueprint says Vercel serverless — see [11-MASTER-PLAN §5b](11-MASTER-PLAN.md) for the drift, its reasons and its security implications** |
| **Database (as-built)** | `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` Docker container `shikhon-postgres`, bound to `127.0.0.1:5433`, dedicated — not the shared cluster that holds the sibling apps. **The blueprint says Neon PostgreSQL 18.4 (`ap-southeast-1`); [06-DEPLOYMENT.md](06-DEPLOYMENT.md) documents the Neon pooler and is not what production runs** (`B-27`) |
| **Deployed commit** | cut by `git archive` from the 2026-08-31 tree (`0b6df00` + `52d1609`). **Nothing from P0–P4 is deployed.** That no deploy has run since is INFERRED from the absence of a later PHASE_LOG entry, not re-observed on the box |
| Repo | `github.com/jmmohiuddin/LMS-SYSTEM`, branch `main`, current at `95c34bf` |
| **Tests** | **1,582 passing, 0 failing** — 2026-09-02, run twice, against a real PostgreSQL 16 (pgvector). offline 50 · server-core 236 · ui-core 161 · academics-svc 141 · identity-svc 20 · ops-svc 98 · platform-svc 40 · rms-svc 62 · sms-svc 67 · sync-svc 23 · pwa 659 · netlify 8. **Without `DATABASE_URL` the same command reports 1,042 and prints "NOTHING RAN" for four workspaces** — the difference is the DB-backed suites, and reading past that line is how a green tick has meant nothing here before |
| **TypeScript** | **0 errors across all THREE configs** — `tsconfig.json`, `apps/pwa/tsconfig.json`, `apps/pwa/tsconfig.sw.json`. Run them with **`npm run typecheck`**, which parses the CI workflow for its list so local and CI scope cannot drift (`B-31`, closed in P5-0). The root config **excludes `apps/pwa`**, so `tsc -p .` alone typechecks the services and not the application. Coverage: **239 of 305** repo `.ts` files; the other 66 are checked by no config and frozen in `scripts/typecheck-baseline.json` (`B-32`) |
| **Build** | `app.js` + `sw.js` + 11 API bundles |
| **Schema** | **62 migrations**, 61 rollback files, 26 SQL assertion suites. **P7 added 051–058; P8 added 059–062**: the commercial model, and the enforcement that made three inert console controls real. Verified on production: **227 RLS policies · 110 RLS-enabled tables · 108 carrying `tenant_id` · 0 tenants visible with no tenant context** |
| **Login** | R-8 turned the kill switch from three hardcoded constants into environment switches that **default OFF** (`packages/server-core/src/go-live.ts`). Whether login is enabled on production is a property of `/etc/shikhon/shikhon.env` and is **NOT OBSERVED from this repository**. `OTP_SENDING_ENABLED` was off at the R-8 deployment; a pilot is designed to run on activation codes, needing no SMS |
| **Surfaces (D15)** | five — `/` shikhonBD marketing (**frozen**) · `/demo` the isolated demo, its own address since P1 · `<slug>.sikhon.systems` the white-labelled tenant app, `/app?tid=` kept as the compatibility door · `platform.sikhon.systems` the Platform Console, `/platform` as compatibility · `/design` a development reference, never a customer destination |
| **UI/UX (D14)** | **P0–P4 complete.** Token foundation · application shell (real desktop, real mobile) · ~30 shared components · teacher screens · student + guardian screens. **P5–P8 not started**; principal, IT-admin and console screens still carry pre-P2 markup. Per-phase detail: [UI-UX-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md](UI-UX-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md) |
| Portals | R-3: principal dashboard (**rebuilt on the design system in P5**), academic drill-down, class/section creation **and renaming** (`B-6`), teacher assignment + replacement with history, bulk moves, rollover, users, guardian links, SMS settings, audit viewer. Guardian **unlinking** now exists (`B-7`, migration 050): the relationship is marked ended, never deleted. Every other Principal and IT Admin screen still carries pre-P2 markup (`B-34`) |
| Onboarding | R-7: a platform operator creates an institution through a nine-step console — no SQL. Three separate credentials; the runtime role still cannot create or list a tenant. The "under one hour" target is **UNMEASURED** (`B-29`) |
| Student record | R-6: global search by permanent ID, name, phone or guardian phone, scoped by `app.can_see_student`; one child's multi-year enrolment timeline with attendance, results, fees and printable documents |
| Documents | R-5: fee receipt, report card, admit card, ID card, transfer certificate, attendance sheet — all on the tenant's own letterhead through ONE renderer. Print-first HTML; **no stored PDF, because object storage is still stubbed** (`B-17`) |
| Calendar | R-4: per-tenant holidays, events and weekends; exams merged from their own tables, never copied. R-4.1: a `working_weekend` row overrides the weekly weekend for SMS |
| Notices | R-2: in-app for every role. SMS reuses the attendance pipeline and **reaches a stubbed aggregator** — tested against a fake one, never delivered to a handset (`B-1`) |
| Completeness | **D13**: a phase is done only when every applicable layer through the UI is verified. Nothing is currently "Backend complete — UI pending"; `POST /rms/solve` stays API-only by an explicit documented decision, not by omission (PHASE_LOG R-3) |
| **Backlog** | one list, with IDs: [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md). Resolved in the closure pass: `B-6`, `B-8`, `B-15`. `B-7` (guardian unlink) is **deferred with its design written**, and remains the highest-consequence open item |
| Preview | `/demo` — every screen, sample data, no login, two tenant brandings, a role picker |

What a teacher can do today (once login is enabled): sign in, see their day/week routine
with substitutions, pick a section and see its roster, take attendance fully offline with
queued sync, enter exam marks component-wise fully offline, and keep working through
network loss. Students and guardians have their own screens as of P4; coordinators can run
the routine solver and the substitution finder over the API.

## 2. Platform: blueprint vs. as-built

The blueprint (01-ARCHITECTURE §1, §3) targets a national-scale platform: Kong gateway,
Kubernetes, NestJS + Go services, Redis/BullMQ, Cloudflare edge. The as-built system is a
deliberate **minimum-infrastructure rendering of the same design** on free-tier primitives —
the domain model, tenancy rules, sync protocol and API shapes are the blueprint's; only the
runtime is substituted.

| Blueprint | As-built | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Kong API gateway, mTLS | Vercel routing + per-function JWT verification (`packages/server-core/src/jwt.ts`, EdDSA as specified) | No gateway to run on Hobby; the JWT contract (§7.2 of 01) is unchanged |
| 6 services (NestJS/Go) on Kubernetes | 6 service *directories* (`services/*-svc`) compiled by esbuild into **12 Vercel functions** | Same ownership boundaries, zero orchestration cost. Hobby caps a deployment at 12 functions — the 3 MFS webhooks were merged into one dynamic route to fit (§3) |
| Next.js 15 SSR shell | Framework-free static PWA (`apps/pwa`, hand-rolled DOM, hash router) | Kills the framework payload entirely; critical-path JS is far under the 180 KB budget of 01 §8 |
| Dexie 4 IndexedDB wrapper | Hand-rolled IndexedDB store (`packages/offline/src/store.ts`) | One less dependency; the outbox schema of 01 §2.2–2.3 is implemented as specified |
| Redis + BullMQ workers | Postgres-table outbox (`sms_outbox`) + Vercel cron | Queue semantics preserved (status/attempts/backoff columns); no Redis to operate |
| PgBouncer transaction pooling | Neon's built-in pooler (also PgBouncer transaction mode) | `SET LOCAL` tenant-context rule verified against the live pooler — see 06 §3 |
| Cloudflare edge, BD data residency | Vercel edge, Singapore DB | Acceptable for dev/staging; **residency must be settled before real student PII lands** (06 §5) |

Everything in **db/** is the blueprint exactly: the migrations in [`db/migrations/`](../db/migrations/)
*are* the DDL that 01 §5 and 02 §4 specify, deployed and assertion-tested (06 §4).

---

## 3. Deployed API surface (10 functions, 2 spare)

Built by [`scripts/build.mjs`](../scripts/build.mjs): each entry is esbuild-bundled (whole
`services/` + `packages/` graph inlined, only `pg` external) into `api/`, which Vercel's
file-based routing serves. **The Hobby plan hard-caps a deployment at 12 Serverless
Functions**; each service is therefore **one dynamic-route function** (an `index.ts`
dispatcher routing to unchanged per-endpoint handler files), leaving 3 slots of headroom.
Two routing quirks learned in production: a multi-segment `[...path]` catch-all does not
match on prebuilt functions (auth is a plain `auth.js` + a `vercel.json` rewrite passing
the subpath as `?path=`), and `build.mjs` clears `api/` before writing so removed entries
can never linger as extra functions.

| Function | Routes | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auth.js` | `POST /api/v1/auth/{otp/request, otp/verify, refresh, logout}` | public / refresh token | OTP request **503 `otp_disabled` while the kill switch is on** (§5); verify issues EdDSA access (15 min) + rotating refresh (30 d) with reuse detection |
| `sync/[action].js` | `POST /api/v1/sync/push`, `GET /api/v1/sync/pull` | JWT | Outbox op batches, idempotent on `opId`; entities: `attendance_session`, **`exam_mark`** (component marks with optimistic concurrency), `class_delivery_log`; cursor-based delta pull |
| `academics/[resource].js` | `GET .../sections`, `GET .../roster`, `GET/POST/PATCH .../exams`, `GET .../marks`, `POST .../publish`, **`GET .../students/search`**, **`GET .../students/history`** | JWT (staff; publish: principal-level) | `exams` answers two questions on one URL: `?sectionId=` is the marks feed (exam-subjects + component maxima), `?yearId=` is the office register (`canManage`, `examTypes`, paper/section/mark counts). **P0/A1:** POST creates an exam **with its papers** in one transaction — one per (section x subject the class teaches), maxima copied from `class_subjects` and frozen — because an exam with no papers is invisible to every consumer. PATCH edits one while it is still unpublished. There is no DELETE: `exams_delete_scope ... USING (false)` refuses every role. Migration 068 separates `routine_published_at` (the timetable was announced) from `status`/`published_at` (the results are out); conflating them made a published routine permanently unmarkable.  `marks` returns roster⋈existing marks + `rowVersion`. Mark **writes** go through sync/push, offline-first. `publish` runs the full result flow in one transaction: `compute_subject_grade` per mark → `compute_exam_gpa` → `exam_results` upsert → section ranks → marking locked + exam published (immutable after). R-6: the two `students/*` routes are TWO SEGMENTS where both hosts route one — the dispatcher keys off the last segment and the documented URL is made to work by a rewrite in `vercel.json` and a second declared path on the Netlify function, not by a second function |
| `platform/[action].js` | `GET/POST /api/v1/platform/{tenants, tenant, provision, branding, admin, import, status, audit}` | **super_admin JWT + `X-Platform-Key` + its own DB role** | R-7. The operator console. Not reachable by any tenant role, including `principal`; `shikhon_app` is explicitly revoked EXECUTE on the DEFINER functions behind it. Answers 503 rather than falling back if `PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL` is unset |
| `rms/[action].js` | `GET .../routine`, `GET/POST .../editor`, `POST .../solve`, `POST .../substitute` | JWT / coordinator roles | `substitute`: free-period + subject-expertise candidate ranking per 02 §5 (find mode) and `routine_substitutions` insert (assign mode); the `check_substitute_free` DB trigger stays the hard guarantee. **P0/A4:** `editor` is the routine writer — `create-routine`, `place`, `assign`, `remove` beside the pre-existing `move` and `publish`. `routines` and `routine_slots` had 0 rows in every tenant before it. The three GiST exclusion constraints on `routine_slots` remain the arbiter and their 23P01 is turned into a named Bangla sentence; teacher and room are additionally pre-checked in the API because those two constraints only apply once `routine_status='active'` (B-74). Teaching days come from `tenants.weekend_days`, never a constant. Publish writes `routines.status` only — never `exams.status` (migration 068). Migration 069 gives all six routine tables per-command write scopes |
| `sms/dispatch.js` | `GET/POST /api/v1/sms/dispatch` | `CRON_SECRET` / `SERVICE_API_KEY` | Outbox drain; **send is a stub** — no aggregator credentials. Cron: daily `0 18 * * *` UTC = 00:00 BST |
| `finance/webhooks/[provider].js` | `POST .../webhooks/{bkash,nagad,rocket}` | webhook signature | Shared processor per 03 §2.4; unknown provider → 404 |
| `finance/[resource].js` | `GET .../invoices`, `POST .../pay`, `GET .../receipts`, `POST .../generate`, `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE .../feestructures`, `GET/POST .../payments` | JWT (RLS-scoped; generate: accountant-level; `feestructures` read = any staff, write = principal / school_owner / accountant / it_admin) | Invoices + lines, money as decimal strings; digital receipts JSON; **`pay` is kill-switched → 503 `mfs_disabled`** pending real merchant credentials (§5). `generate` runs the monthly invoice batch from `fee_structures` (class-specific beats class-wide, best `fee_waiver` per line, idempotent per student+period). **P0/A2:** `feestructures` is the writer that table never had — before it, `generate` joined an empty table and issued empty bills. Migration 067 adds the per-command RESTRICTIVE write scopes and `uq_fee_structure_scope … NULLS NOT DISTINCT`. No `quota_category` field is offered, because the invoice run joins `fs.quota_category IS NULL`. **P-writers/B-48:** `payments` is the counter — it applies the payment, issues the receipt and posts the balanced ledger pair in one transaction, for the three money roles. Partial payments are the normal case (a receipt per payment, no uniqueness on `invoice_id`); an overpayment is refused by name because `balance_amount` is a generated column. `pay` remains kill-switched — the online flow needs merchant credentials. Migration 070 scopes `payment_receipts` and `invoice_lines`, and `app.next_receipt_no()` replaces an inline `max()+1` that let a concurrent payment be applied with no receipt |
| `ai/[engine].js` | `POST /api/v1/ai/sikhok`, `POST /api/v1/ai/shikho` | JWT (sikhok: staff) | SikhokAI (CQ/MCQ/rubric/lesson-plan, Claude Opus) + ShikhoAI (Socratic tutor, Claude Haiku) via the Anthropic SDK. **503 `ai_disabled` until `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set** (§5). NCTB-scope-bounded prompts, PII redaction before egress, `ai_sessions`/`ai_turns` audit. RAG runs lexical-only until the NCTB corpus is ingested (responses carry `grounded: false`) |
| `ans/[action].js` | `GET /api/v1/ans/students`, `POST .../dispatch`, `POST .../inbound` | `SERVICE_API_KEY` (+`CRON_SECRET` for dispatch) | Batch pull with `globalPersonId` merge keys and consent-gated contact fields; HMAC-SHA256-signed outbound webhook dispatcher over `alumni_export_logs` (backoff, dead-letter, stable `delivery_id`); inbound staged into `ans_inbound_events`, applied only after review |
| `ops/maintenance.js` | `GET/POST /api/v1/ops/maintenance` | `CRON_SECRET` / `SERVICE_API_KEY` | Second daily cron (01:00 BST): `app.maintain_partitions()` / `purge_expired_data()` / `refresh_dashboards()` over `DATABASE_MAINTENANCE_URL` (owner role, direct endpoint — the DDL these need), plus a default-partition-leakage report. **503 `maintenance_unconfigured` until that env var is set** |
| `ops/[action].js` | `GET/PUT /api/v1/ops/branding` | JWT (PUT: principal / school_owner / it_admin / academic_coordinator) | R-1. Full tenant branding, read by any signed-in member (documents need the letterhead) and written by the four roles that own structural settings. No tenant id in URL or body — the only tenant a caller can name is the one they authenticated as; `tenant_self` RLS is the boundary |
| `ops/[action].js` | `GET /api/v1/ops/brand?slug=\|tid=` | **public** | R-1. Pre-auth login-screen identity: seven signboard fields only, fixed by an explicit key allowlist in `app.public_branding()`. Exact-key lookup, so it cannot enumerate; an unknown key returns neutral defaults with 200 rather than a 404 existence oracle |
| `ops/[action].js` | `GET /api/v1/ops/manifest?slug=\|tid=` | **public** | R-1. Per-tenant `application/manifest+json`, so installing tenant A's PWA yields A's name, icon and theme colour. `start_url` carries `?tid=` |

Conventions that differ from 03: the base URL is **`https://sikhon.systems/api/v1`**
(not `api.shikhon.bd/v1`; and no longer `shikhon-lms.vercel.app/api/v1`, which was the
address until the 2026-08-31 VPS deployment and is now a stale artefact — see
[11-MASTER-PLAN §5b](11-MASTER-PLAN.md)), and errors are plain `{ error, message }` JSON
rather than RFC 9457 problem+json. Everything else (idempotency, webhook processing order, money-as-string) is
implemented as specified.

---

## 4. PWA as-built

`apps/pwa` — framework-free TypeScript, Bangla-first, sized for the 360×640 / 2 GB /
2G reference device of 04.

| Piece | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Entry + boot | `src/app.ts` | Resolves tenant from `?tid=`/localStorage; Auth-gates the shell; `?demo=1` bypass (§6) |
| Auth/session | `src/auth.ts` | Tokens in localStorage; silent refresh 60 s ahead of expiry; `authedFetch()` used by every view. **A refused refresh is distinguished from a failed one (B-121):** only 401/403 clear the session and fire `onSessionEnded`; a 5xx or a thrown `fetch` keeps the session and returns the stale token, so a bad minute on the server — or being offline — never signs a school out |
| Login | `src/login-view.ts` | Phone → OTP → verify; **currently short-circuits to a disabled notice** (§5) |
| Session ended | `src/app.ts` — `showSessionEnded()` | The screen a dead credential gets instead of a retry that cannot succeed (B-121). `role="alert"`, one focused action, and a different sentence per ending. **Two, not three:** 401 covers expired, rotated **and revoked** — `refresh.ts` matches on `revoked_at IS NULL`, so a device revoked via B-120 is indistinguishable from an expired one and “sign in again” is right for all three; 403 (`account_not_active` or `no_active_role`) gets its own heading and “লগইন স্ক্রিনে ফিরে যান”, because only the office can fix it. Runs the same `purgeLocalData('logout')` a real logout runs; the IndexedDB **outbox and the device id are deliberately untouched** |
| Shell | `src/shell.ts` | Hash router + bottom tab bar (হাজিরা / রুটিন / শিক্ষার্থী), logout in the top bar |
| Attendance | `src/attendance-view.ts` | The 30-second grid of 04 §4.1; writes go to the outbox, never await the network |
| Roster | `src/roster-view.ts` | Section picker + list; localStorage cache with offline banner; feeds the attendance grid its real roster |
| Routine | `src/routine-view.ts` | Day/week toggle; substitution and attendance-taken chips; localStorage cache |
| Marks entry | `src/marks-view.ts` | নম্বর tab: exam-subject picker → component-wise entry (CQ/MCQ/practical/CA), absent toggle, offline cache; each changed row becomes one `exam_mark` outbox op with `rowVersion` optimistic concurrency; published/locked exams render read-only |
| More menu | `src/more-view.ts` | আরও tab — the five-tab bar stays fixed; additional feature pages are hidden-but-routable (`ShellRoute.hidden`) behind this menu and deep-linkable by hash |
| Fees | `src/fees-view.ts` | Invoice list (status/balance, Bangla-numeral taka), expandable lines with waivers, lazily-fetched receipts; visibility follows RLS `invoice_scope` |
| Substitution finder | `src/substitute-view.ts` | Date → own teaching slots → ranked free/subject-matched candidates → one-tap assign; `substitute_conflict` re-runs the search; 403 surfaced plainly for non-coordinators |
| SikhokAI | `src/sikhok-view.ts` | CQ/MCQ/rubric/lesson-plan form over `/ai/sikhok`; friendly `ai_disabled` state; ungrounded output carries a verify-before-use notice |
| ShikhoAI | `src/shikho-view.ts` | Socratic tutor chat over `/ai/shikho` (Bangla/English/Banglish), class-level selector, `ai_disabled` banner |
| Branding editor | `src/branding-view.ts` | R-1 প্রতিষ্ঠানের পরিচয়: name / logo / favicon / watermark / signature / colours / contact, with a live preview whose letterhead panel calls ui-core's `brandedLetterhead()` — the same function the documents will — so the preview cannot drift from the paper. Images are downscaled on-device to the byte cap rather than refused. A 403 renders it read-only |
| Branding runtime | `src/branding.ts` | Applies the tenant's identity to the document: colour tokens (light + dark), title, favicon, theme colour, manifest link. Cache-first then revalidate, keyed per tenant, re-validated on read because localStorage is writable by anything on the origin |
| Sync | `packages/offline/` | Outbox engine per 01 §2.3: UUIDv7-keyed ops, monotonic `seq`, exponential backoff with jitter, conflict surfacing |
| Service worker | `src/sw.ts` + `src/sw-router.ts` | Route policy of 01 §2.4 (network-only for auth/sync, SWR for reference data, cache-first for hashed assets, app-shell fallback for navigations) |
| Data saver | (policy module, tested) | 2G/`saveData` drops avatars, lengthens sync interval; WASM cropper skipped on ≤2 GB devices — 04 §6 |

TypeScript is checked as **two programs** — `apps/pwa/tsconfig.json` (DOM lib) and
`apps/pwa/tsconfig.sw.json` (WebWorker lib) — because the DOM and WebWorker global typings
are incompatible in one program. CI-equivalent local gate:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit && npx tsc --noEmit -p apps/pwa/tsconfig.json && npx tsc --noEmit -p apps/pwa/tsconfig.sw.json
```

## 5. Kill switches (what is deliberately off, and how to turn it on)

**Since R-8 these are environment variables, not constants in source.** They were
`const`s that had to be edited, rebuilt and redeployed — and the login switch was
*two* constants, one server-side and one in the browser bundle, with a comment
asking that they be kept in sync. Two things that must be edited together do not
stay in sync. `packages/server-core/src/go-live.ts` is now the single reader.

All follow the same pattern: fail closed with a specific error code, before any
side effect. Only the word `true` enables anything (case-insensitively); `1`,
`yes`, `on` and `enabled` all resolve **off**, because a switch that stayed off
gets reported by an operator and a switch that turned itself on gets reported by
a parent.

| Feature | Environment variable | Off because | To enable |
|---|---|---|---|
| OTP login | `OTP_SENDING_ENABLED` | No SMS aggregator contract | Set it to `true`. **No rebuild** — the browser learns it from `GET /api/v1/ops/brand` |
| MFS payment initiation | `MFS_PAYMENTS_ENABLED` | No live merchant credentials | Wire gateway calls + credentials, then set it to `true` |
| AI engines | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (presence) | No API key configured | Set the key. Per-tenant budget enforcement (R-8) is live and applies immediately |
| Real SMS sending | `SMS_PROVIDER` + `SMS_ENDPOINT` + `SMS_API_TOKEN` + `SMS_SENDER_ID` | No aggregator contract | Set all four. Naming a provider **without** the other three throws at startup rather than silently reverting to the stub |
| Delivery reports | `SMS_DLR_SECRET` | No aggregator to send them | Set it and give the aggregator the value. Unset, `POST /api/v1/sms/dlr` answers **503**, not 401 |

| Web push (R-9) | `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` + `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` | Not generated | Run `node scripts/generate-vapid-keys.mjs`. **No vendor** — the keys are self-issued. Unset, every message still goes by SMS |

| SMS allowlist (R-8) | `SMS_TEST_RECIPIENTS` | Not restricted | Set a comma-separated E.164 list to restrict sending to your own team. Every other queued row is written and marked `suppressed`/`not_in_test_allowlist`, so a pilot sees exactly what would have gone out |

| Per-school subdomains (R-8 §9D) | `WILDCARD_DNS_READY` | `*.shikhonbd.com` has no DNS or TLS | Provision the wildcard record and certificate, load a tenant subdomain over HTTPS, then set it to `true`. Unset, the console marks the subdomain **এখনো চালু হয়নি** and presents the `?tid=` install link as the address to print |

| CORS origins (R-8) | `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Unrestricted (`*`) | Set to the deployment's own origins. Unset, behaviour is unchanged — the API is bearer-token only, so `*` is broad rather than exploitable |

The login switch is now one-sided. `apps/pwa/src/login-view.ts` reads
`isLoginDisabled()`, which reads a value cached from the server's `otpLogin` — so
the browser cannot disagree with the server about whether login works. A device
that has never reached the server reads it as OFF, which offers the
activation-code path and therefore cannot strand anybody.

While OTP is off, `POST /auth/otp/request` returns `503 { error: "otp_disabled" }`
before any DB write. Everything else is untouched: verify/refresh/logout still
work, so **already-logged-in sessions keep working**, and activation-code login is
unaffected.

**When enabled, a real SMS is now sent** — the code is queued to `sms_outbox` in
the same transaction as the challenge and carried by the ordinary dispatcher. It
reaches a phone only if an aggregator is also configured; with `SMS_PROVIDER`
unset it goes to the stub, which logs. The `X-Debug-Otp` echo (gated on
`SERVICE_API_KEY`) is kept for testing without a phone.

**Which of these a deployment actually has is not something to work out by
reading env vars:** the platform console's গো-লাইভ অবস্থা screen
(`GET /api/v1/platform/readiness`) reports all of it, marking each item blocking
or advisory, and reports presence without ever echoing a value.

---

## 6. Demo mode

**`https://sikhon.systems/demo`** previews every screen with sample data while login
is off. The address matters: until P1 the demo had *no* route of its own and `/app` fell
into demo mode implicitly whenever nobody was logged in — so a real teacher who was merely
logged out saw fabricated students under their own school's door. `/demo` is now its own
surface (D15) and `/app` logged-out goes to login. The old `?demo=1` query form is
superseded. `apps/pwa/src/demo.ts` provides `DemoAuth`, a drop-in `Auth` substitute whose
`authedFetch()` answers sections/roster/routine/sync-push **locally** — no session exists,
no request leaves the device, and it cannot touch real tenant data. The top bar shows
"ডেমো (নমুনা তথ্য)" so it is never mistaken for a real session. A normal (non-demo) boot
purges any demo leftovers from the shared localStorage caches, so a later real login never
sees sample data.

---

## 7. RMS: deep-dive vs. as-built

02-RMS-DEEP-DIVE specifies CP-SAT-class solving. The as-built solver
(`services/rms-svc/src/solve.ts`) is a **greedy heuristic with weighted soft-constraint
scoring** — most-constrained-assignment-first ordering over the hard-constraint-feasible
domain, then hill-climbing on the soft objective of 02 §3.3.

What holds regardless of solver quality: **clash-freedom is enforced by the database**, not
the solver. The three `btree_gist` exclusion constraints of 02 §4.1 (teacher, section, room
per timeslot) make a double-booking structurally impossible to commit — a worse solver can
produce a lower-scoring routine, never an invalid one. The read path
(`GET /api/v1/rms/routine` → `app.teacher_day()`) and the substitution merge are as
specified in 02 §2.2. Upgrading the solver to OR-Tools CP-SAT is a drop-in replacement
behind the same `/rms/solve` contract (Phase 3 in 05).

---

## 8. Operations runbook

**Deploy** (also runs on `git push` via Vercel Git integration):
```bash
node scripts/build.mjs        # typecheck is separate — see §4 gate
vercel --prod --yes
```

**Migrations** — owner role, direct (non-pooled) endpoint only:
```bash
DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL='postgresql://neondb_owner:…@ep-late-fog-azjd29xn.c-3.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/shikhon_lms?sslmode=require' \
  ./scripts/migrate.sh --with-tests
```
`migrate.sh` refuses to run against a non-empty schema (the migrations are not idempotent);
`--force` is the deliberate override. Rollback files in `db/rollback/` are re-runnable.

**JWT keys:** `node scripts/generate-jwt-keys.mjs` → paste into `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` /
`JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` Vercel env vars. Re-running rotates the pair and invalidates all live
access tokens.

**Env vars (Vercel, Production):** `DATABASE_URL` (must be `shikhon_runtime` on the
**pooled** endpoint — never the owner role; see 06 §2), `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`, `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY`,
`CRON_SECRET`, `SERVICE_API_KEY`. Optional feature enables: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (turns the
AI gateway on; `AI_MODEL_SIKHOK`/`AI_MODEL_SHIKHO` override the models), `ANS_SIGNING_SECRET`
(outbound ANS webhook signing until KMS-managed per-endpoint keys exist),
`DATABASE_MAINTENANCE_URL` (owner role on the direct endpoint — turns the nightly DB
maintenance cron live).

**Cron:** two Hobby-safe daily jobs in `vercel.json` — `/api/v1/sms/dispatch` at 00:00 BST
and `/api/v1/ops/maintenance` at 01:00 BST. The maintenance job stays a 503 no-op until
`DATABASE_MAINTENANCE_URL` is set (owner role, direct endpoint — the value
`scripts/migrate.sh` uses); every run reports default-partition leakage so the docs/06
canary is checked automatically.

**Smoke test:**
```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{ssl_verify_result}\n' https://sikhon.systems/
```
*(Superseded: this was `curl --resolve shikhon-lms.vercel.app:443:216.198.79.3 …`, a
workaround for local networks that failed to resolve `*.vercel.app`. Production is no
longer on Vercel and the pinned IP is meaningless — kept named here only so anyone who
finds the old command elsewhere knows why it no longer applies.)*

## 9. Security posture — open items

Carried forward from 06 §6, updated after Phase 0:

- [ ] **Rotate the exposed `neondb_owner` password** (`npg_…` — was shared in plaintext).
      Until rotated, treat the owner credential as compromised. It must never be the app's
      `DATABASE_URL` in any case (BYPASSRLS voids all tenant isolation). Ledger row is open
      in [08-CREDENTIAL-ROTATION.md](08-CREDENTIAL-ROTATION.md) §3.
- [ ] **Revoke the exposed MongoDB credential** (from an earlier experiment; unused by this
      system but still live — an unused live credential is pure liability).
- [x] App connects as `shikhon_runtime` (non-BYPASSRLS) on the pooled endpoint.
- [x] Runtime password exists only in Vercel's `DATABASE_URL`; no local copies remain.
- [x] EdDSA JWTs, 15-min access / 30-day rotating refresh with reuse detection, as 01 §7.2.
- [x] **No credential has ever been committed to this repository** — verified across every
      commit on every branch, and re-verified by CI on every push
      (`scripts/check-secrets.mjs --history`).
- [x] Deploy preflight refuses a missing, placeholder or dangerously wrong secret
      (`scripts/check-secrets.mjs --env`).
- [x] **Rate limiting on every endpoint (F-102)** — token buckets in Postgres, per-IP sized
      for a school behind one NAT gateway and per-identity carrying the real abuse control.
      This was the hard gate on re-enabling login.
- [x] **Field-level encryption for NID/BRC (F-101)** — AES-256-GCM with per-tenant HKDF
      derivation, versioned keys, and database guards that refuse plaintext independently of
      the application. Ships dark until `PII_MASTER_KEY_V1` is set, which is the correct
      failure: it is never possible to store an identifier in the clear because a key was
      missing.
- [ ] Set `PII_MASTER_KEY_V1` in Vercel — board registration and MPO filing cannot work
      until it exists. See [08-CREDENTIAL-ROTATION.md](08-CREDENTIAL-ROTATION.md) §5 **before**
      touching it; rotation is additive and replacing V1 in place destroys data silently.
- [ ] Wire DB maintenance functions to a scheduler (§8).
- [ ] Production data-residency decision (Singapore → Bangladesh) before real PII lands.
- [ ] Curriculum-specialist verification of NCTB subject codes (06 §6).

## 9a. Phase 0 — closed

Six requirements, one commit each, tests in the same commit.

| ID | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| F-102 | Rate limiting on every endpoint | migration 020, `packages/server-core/src/rate-limit.ts` |
| F-101 | Field-level encryption for NID / birth registration | migration 021, `packages/server-core/src/pii-crypto.ts` |
| F-103 | Row-version optimistic lock on assignment grading | `services/academics-svc/api/assignments.ts` |
| F-104 | Prerequisite cycle prevention (recursive-CTE trigger) | migration 022 |
| F-105 | Credential rotation confirmed and recorded | `scripts/check-secrets.mjs`, [08](08-CREDENTIAL-ROTATION.md) |
| F-106 | Backfill tests: assignments, practice, next, results, ledger | `services/academics-svc/test/api.test.ts`, `db/tests/ledger.sql` |

### Two defects the work uncovered

**Every student-facing read was blocked by RLS** (migration 023). Six tables paired a
`FOR SELECT` read policy with a `FOR ALL` write policy, both RESTRICTIVE. Since RESTRICTIVE
policies AND together and `FOR ALL` includes SELECT, the read policy was cancelled out — so
students and guardians could not read a chapter, a lesson, a content block, a practice
question, a homework assignment or an invoice. Homework submission failed too, on a NOT NULL
violation from the lateness trigger. Only staff ever exercised these paths, so nothing failed
loudly; this is very likely why the app only ever looked right in demo mode. Found by the
F-106 tests, which were the first thing to query these tables as a student.

**The audit trail was never writable** (repaired in migration 021). Migration 010 granted
`shikhon_app` INSERT on `audit.pii_access` and `audit.activity_log`, but granted sequence
USAGE only in schema `public` — both tables are `bigserial` in schema `audit`. Every audit
write would have failed on "permission denied for sequence". Nothing had been written yet,
so nothing was lost.

### Knowing what production actually runs

The open question through all of Phase 0 was whether migrations 016–019
were ever applied — and there was no way to answer it, because the
migrations are not idempotent and nothing records what has run.

`scripts/migration-status.mjs` answers it by probing, not by trusting a
ledger that does not exist. Read-only, no owner credential:

```bash
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://…' node scripts/migration-status.mjs --plan
```

Each migration is probed for an object created at the *end* of its file, so
a migration that died half-way reads MISSING rather than applied. It refuses
to hand out a simple apply plan when the chain is out of order, and CI fails
if a migration is ever added without a matching probe.

**Until this is run against production, treat every Phase 0 guarantee in
§9 as code-complete but not in force.** Migration 023 in particular is what
unbreaks the student-facing product.

### Two status corrections to the PRD

Both were recorded as "Built" and are not:

- **F-502 (manual routine editor)** → should read **Partial**. `routine-view.ts` is 227
  lines and read-only: no drag-and-drop, no live constraint feedback.
- **F-1304 (mandatory human review of AI content)** → was recorded **Built**, was actually
  **New**, and is now **enforced in the database** (migration 024). The `reviewed_by`,
  `is_approved` and `ai_session_id` columns had existed since migration 005 and appeared in
  zero lines of application code — the same shape as F-101's encryption columns and F-103's
  `row_version`.

  The gate went in *before* the code path that would violate it: nothing today writes
  generated content to the item bank, so this is the cheapest this will ever be. Approval
  requires a named reviewer, `reviewed_at` is stamped by the database rather than accepted
  from the caller, AI-generated items must keep the `ai_session_id` that produced them, and
  — the one that matters in practice — **editing an approved item revokes its approval**,
  including a change to an MCQ option or a CQ part. Review does not usually get skipped;
  review goes stale.

  Paper generation must select from the `student_ready_question_items` view, never from
  `question_items` directly. A filter you have to remember is a filter someone will forget.

---

## 9b. R-1 — white-label & branding foundation (closed)

The first phase of [11-MASTER-PLAN.md](11-MASTER-PLAN.md). Tenancy was already
enforced everywhere it mattered for data; what was missing was the visible half —
every school saw **ShikhonBD** on its own login screen.

### What was implemented

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Branding contract — schema, validation, colour derivation, WCAG contrast | `packages/ui-core/src/branding.ts` |
| Print foundation — letterhead, watermark, signature, standalone A4 document | `packages/ui-core/src/branded-doc.ts` |
| Seed + pre-auth read function + shape guard | `db/migrations/039_tenant_branding.sql` |
| `GET/PUT /ops/branding`, `GET /ops/brand`, `GET /ops/manifest` | `services/ops-svc/api/`, shared lookup in `services/ops-svc/src/public-branding.ts` |
| Runtime application + per-tenant cache | `apps/pwa/src/branding.ts` |
| Editor with live preview | `apps/pwa/src/branding-view.ts` |
| Institution plate in the shell; institution mark on login | `apps/pwa/src/shell.ts`, `src/login-view.ts` |
| Two demo institutions for side-by-side verification | `apps/pwa/src/demo.ts` |

### Where branding lives, and why

`tenants.settings->'branding'` — a column, not a table. It is exactly one row per
tenant, always read whole, never joined, never queried by any of its fields. It
inherits the `tenant_self` RLS policy from 010 and the `app.enforce_tenant()`
immutability guarantee by being part of the tenant row. Assets are inline data
URLs under per-field byte caps (logo 64 KB, favicon 32 KB, watermark 96 KB,
signature 48 KB; 320 KB total), so R-1 needed no object storage — that decision
has still not arrived: R-5 shipped print-first HTML and no stored artifact, so
`payment_receipts.pdf_object_key` and `student_profiles.photo_key` remain NULL,
and the ID card prints a labelled photo frame rather than an image.

### What actually enforces isolation

Not the handlers. `tenant_self` (`id = app.current_tenant()`, FORCE'd) is the
boundary, and every statement runs inside `withTenant()`. The endpoints carry no
tenant id in URL or body, so the only tenant a caller can name is the one they
authenticated as; `requireRole()` is a clean 403 in front of the policy, not the
policy. `db/tests/tenant_branding.sql` asserts this directly — with tenant A's
session context, an `UPDATE … WHERE id = <B>` matches **zero rows**.

The one deliberate exception is `app.public_branding()`, `SECURITY DEFINER` with a
pinned `search_path`: the login screen and the manifest are fetched before any
session exists. It answers by exact key only (slug *or* tenant id — the install
link carries the id), returns seven signboard fields fixed by an allowlist **in
SQL**, and returns nothing for an unknown key. Contact details, head teacher,
watermark and signature stay behind authentication.

### Tests

61 new, all passing: `packages/ui-core/test/branding.test.ts` (24 — validation,
refusals, colour derivation), `branded-doc.test.ts` (13 — escaping, two-tenant
document isolation), `apps/pwa/test/branding-ui.test.ts` (19 — apply, cache,
login, shell), `services/ops-svc/test/branding.test.ts` (5 pure + a DB-backed
suite), and `db/tests/tenant_branding.sql` wired into `database.yml`. A CI guard
in `frontend.yml` fails the build if platform branding reappears in tenant-facing
UI (`landing.html` is exempt — that page is the platform talking about itself).

### Acceptance test

`?demo=1&tenant=a` and `?demo=1&tenant=b` on one deployment: different name, logo,
colour, address, head teacher; different browser title, theme colour, favicon and
manifest URL; different printed letterhead; and no value of one appearing anywhere
in the other's DOM or cache. Verified in a browser, not only asserted.

### Known limitations

- **The DB-backed half of `services/ops-svc/test/branding.test.ts` and
  `db/tests/tenant_branding.sql` have not been executed** — no PostgreSQL was
  reachable on the machine R-1 was built on. They are written to the conventions of
  the suites around them and are wired into `database.yml`, so the first CI run is
  their first execution. Until that run is green, R-1's isolation guarantee is
  code-complete and CI-pending, exactly as §9a says of Phase 0.
- **Two front doors.** `apps/pwa/public/index.html` — what `/` actually serves — is
  the Ata Ekta design mock-up: 66 static screens, no API calls, no `app.js`. The
  functional TypeScript PWA is `index.legacy.html`. Both are branded (the mock-up by
  an inline bootstrap using the same cache key and endpoint), but which one is the
  product is an open question this phase did not resolve.
- **A branding change does not reach an already-open tab** on another device until
  it reloads; there is no push. The service worker serves `/ops/brand` stale-
  while-revalidate, so the next launch is correct.
- **`app.js` is cache-first in the service worker and is not content-hashed**, so a
  deploy does not reach a returning device until `CACHE_SHELL`'s version string
  changes. Pre-existing, and it made local verification of R-1 misleading twice
  before it was noticed; worth a version bump policy before the pilot.
- Migration **038 still has no probe** in `scripts/migration-status.mjs` — it only
  alters columns, which the current probe kinds cannot express. 039's probe is
  present.
- Colour customisation is deliberately bounded to primary + accent. Status colours
  (absent, overdue, paid) and the destructive `--c-accent` are not tenant-controlled.

---

## 9c. R-1-A — three surfaces, three addresses (closed)

Until 2026-08-29, `/` served a design mock-up and the functional application was
reachable only by typing `/index.legacy.html`. Option B of the three set out in
[PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md) was chosen and implemented.

| Address | File | Surface | Brand |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | `public/index.html` *(was `landing.html`)* | shikhonBD marketing site | **platform** |
| `/app` | `public/app.html` *(was `index.legacy.html`)* | the tenant application | white-labelled |
| `/design` | `public/design.html` *(was `index.html`)* | Ata Ekta prototype, retained | white-labelled |

**Routing.** `vercel.json` rewrites `/app`, `/app/:path*` and `/design`; `/`
resolves to `index.html` through the static filesystem. `netlify.toml` declares
the same three redirects **before** its catch-all, which now lands on marketing
rather than on the application. The `/api/v1/auth/:path*` rewrite is untouched.
The app is a hash router, so `/app#/routine` needs no server route of its own.

**Service worker.** Three changes, all narrow:

- Only `/app*` navigations get the `app-shell` strategy. The worker's scope is
  still `/` (it must control `/app.js`), so it *sees* the marketing site —
  answering that with the app's HTML would have re-created the very confusion
  R-1-A closed.
- `PRECACHE` and the offline fallback point at `/app`, not `/`. A teacher who
  loses signal gets the attendance screen, not a page selling the product.
- `/app.js`, `/app.css` and `/manifest.webmanifest` moved from `cache-first` to
  `stale-while-revalidate`. They are not content-hashed, so they matched the
  IMMUTABLE extension test and were pinned forever — **the deploy-staleness bug
  recorded in §9b's known limitations, now fixed**. Offline is unaffected: the
  cached copy still answers instantly. `CACHE_SHELL` bumped to `v2` so returning
  devices drop the poisoned v1 cache on activate.

**PWA.** Generated and static manifests both use `start_url: /app` (plus `?tid=`)
and `scope: /app`, so a school's installed icon opens that school's application.

**Tenant resolution is unchanged** — `?tid=` still works exactly as before, no
second mechanism was introduced, and no school-picker exists (D12).

**Verified in a browser**, not only asserted: `/` shows the shikhonBD site with
CTAs pointing at `/app`; `/app?tenant=a` and `?tenant=b` show two different
institutions' applications; `/design` shows the 66-screen prototype; and with the
origin server **stopped**, `/app` still boots the full application with Tenant A's
identity from the service-worker cache.

**17 new tests** in `apps/pwa/test/surfaces.test.ts` cover surface identity by
content, both hosts' routing tables, the app-shell scoping, the unhashed-asset
policy, the cache-version bump, and the manifest. Three pre-existing tests
encoding the old `/`-based contract were updated with the reason recorded inline.

**Remaining limitation:** the prototype at `/design` is still built from static
sample data and is not covered by any behavioural test — it is kept as a design
reference, and whether it earns its place is a later question.

---

## 9d. R-2 — notices and in-app notifications (closed)

Before this, the product had no way to tell anybody anything.
`academics-svc/api/ward.ts` said so outright, refusing to stub the notices card
§9.1 draws because "this schema has no notices table".

**Migration 040** adds `notices` (what the author wrote) and `notice_receipts`
(one row per person per notice). Receipts are **materialised at publish**, not
resolved at read: a notice's audience is a question about the past — who was in
Class 9 Science F on the day it went out — and a live query answers it about the
present. A student who transfers in next week must not retroactively acquire
last week's notices.

**Audience resolution** is `app.resolve_notice_audience()`, `SECURITY DEFINER`
with a pinned `search_path` and an explicit tenant assertion. It returns
`(user_id, about_student_id)`; a guardian appears **once per child in scope**,
which is what lets the ward view file a notice under the child it concerns —
and is why a guardian of two children gets two receipts for a school-wide
notice and one for a section notice.

**The client never sends a recipient list.** It sends intent
(`{type:'section', ids:[…]}`). A client-supplied roster would be the
confused-deputy shape R-1 removed from branding, and worse here: the wrong
roster does not show a school the wrong logo, it tells 900 guardians something
meant for the staff.

**What stops a student reading a teachers-only notice** is neither the category
nor the UI: it is the absence of a receipt. `notice_read_scope` (RESTRICTIVE)
admits a notice only to management, its author, or someone holding a receipt.

**SMS reuses the attendance pipeline entirely.** Publishing emits
`notice.published.v1` into `event_outbox`; `sms-svc` stage 1 grew a second
consumer sharing **one** daily cap, **one** weekend/holiday suppression and
**one** dedupe index. There is no second SMS path — SMS is ~80% of the
infrastructure bill (docs/05 §5) and a second path is a second place for it to
double. Emergencies deliberately bypass weekend/holiday suppression: "school is
closed today" is exactly the message a parent needs on a day it is closed.

**A D11 violation was found and fixed here.** The attendance SMS templates
ended `— ShikhonBD`. An SMS to a guardian is a tenant operational surface; a
parent should be told by the school their child attends, not by a company they
have never heard of. Templates now take the institution's name, read from
`settings->'branding'`. R-1's CI guard did not catch it because that guard only
reads `apps/pwa`.

**Notice SMS is capped at 180 characters** (`NOTICE_SMS_MAX_BODY`) — headline
plus a lead, pointing at the app. A 4000-character notice is 58 UCS-2 segments
per guardian; to 900 guardians that is over ৳20,000 for one message. The
composer shows the per-recipient segment count as the body is typed.

**UI:** a bell with an unread badge in every role's top bar; an inbox where
opening a notice is what marks it read; a composer whose audience is restated
in plain Bangla immediately above the send button. Notices are
stale-while-revalidate in the service worker, so the bell works offline.

**45 new tests** (477 total): `packages/ui-core/test/notice.test.ts` (23 — the
audience refusals, and that Bangla costs 70 characters per segment),
`apps/pwa/test/notices-ui.test.ts` (22 — bell, inbox, composer), and
`db/tests/notices.sql` wired into `database.yml`, asserting that a staff notice
reaches no student, a section notice reaches that section's guardians and
nobody else's, a sibling guardian gets one receipt per child, re-publishing is
free, and a student cannot read a notice by id.

### R-2 finalisation (2026-08-29)

Four gaps from R-2's own report were closed before the phase was called done.

**1 · The DB-backed suites were executed.** A PostgreSQL 16 (pgvector) container
matching CI ran the full chain: 40 migrations silently, schema lint, invariants,
tenant_branding, notices, e2e_academic_cycle, an idempotency re-run leaving zero
rows, a descending rollback leaving **zero objects**, and a clean re-apply.
Running them found five real defects that had been sitting in committed code:
an invalid `institution_level` enum value in R-1's suite, `user_roles.role_id`
(the column is `role_code`), `sections.class_offering_id` (it is `class_id`;
`class_offerings` does not exist in this schema), `ON CONFLICT ON CONSTRAINT`
against a **partial unique index** (which needs the column list plus its
predicate), and a rollback that left two functions behind so `DROP TYPE` was
refused and up → down → up failed.

**2 · The three auto-emitters are built.** `app.emit_auto_notice()` is the single
entry point — three copies of "insert a notice and publish it" would be three
places to get the idempotency wrong. Idempotency is a partial unique index on
`(tenant_id, source_kind, source_ref)`, so a corrected-and-republished exam
routine or a re-run invoice batch announces nothing twice. Each runs in the same
transaction as the event it announces, so a rolled-back publish takes its notice
with it.

| Event | Audience | Key |
|---|---|---|
| Exam routine published | students + guardians of the sections with a paper in it | `('exam_routine', examId)` |
| Results published | the same people; the notice carries **no marks** | `('result', examId)` |
| Invoices generated | `guardians_payers` — a new audience type honouring `can_pay_fees` | `('invoice', md5(period))` |

A payment reminder to someone with no authority to pay is noise that costs an
SMS, which is why `guardians_payers` is a distinct audience rather than reusing
`guardians`. The result notice deliberately says results are available and
nothing more: a grade is not something to put in a notification a sibling might
read over a shoulder.

**3 · `publish_at` is now real.** `scheduled` became a status — a draft is
unfinished, a scheduled notice is finished and waiting, and the sweeper must
publish one and never the other. `app.publish_due_notices()` runs from the
**existing** nightly ops/maintenance cron; no scheduler, no queue, no new
process. `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` stops two overlapping runs double-emitting the
SMS event. The cost is granularity — a notice set for 09:00 goes out on the next
maintenance run — and the composer says exactly that where the time is chosen
rather than implying precision it cannot deliver.

**4 · SMS length is a default, not a limit.** 180 characters stays the
recommendation; a school may set `tenants.settings->'sms'->>'noticeMaxChars'`
anywhere from 70 (one Bangla segment) to a 480 hard ceiling. Past that an SMS
has stopped being an alert and the honest answer is a shorter notice, not a
bigger budget. The composer states the policy — *"এসএমএসে সংক্ষিপ্ত বার্তা যাবে;
পুরো নোটিশ অ্যাপে থাকবে"* — and shows the live per-recipient segment count.
Every SMS carries the institution's name.

`sms-svc` gained a test workspace in the process; the most cost-sensitive code
in the product had none. Its 13 tests found a real robustness bug:
`Number([])` is 0 and `Number(true)` is 1, both finite, so junk in the settings
blob would have clamped every alert to one segment instead of falling back.

**Known limitations that remain:**

- **No real-time delivery.** The badge refreshes on boot and after publishing; a
  notice arriving while the app is open appears on the next navigation. A timer
  polling on 2G would cost more than the freshness is worth; WebSocket delivery
  is a later phase.
- **Scheduling granularity is the cron's**, not the minute. Stated in the UI.
- **Editing a published notice is not supported.** Re-publishing after widening
  an audience reaches only the new people, which is correct, but there is no UI.
- SMS send remains stubbed until an aggregator contract (R-8): notice SMS queues
  into `sms_outbox` and nothing leaves the building.
- The emitters are wired at the three publish points but their **endpoint-level**
  behaviour is covered by the SQL suite and a scripted end-to-end check, not by
  an HTTP integration test.

## 9e. R-3 — principal & IT admin portals (closed)

The first phase built under D13, and the first whose completeness was decided
by whether a person can use the thing rather than by whether the endpoint
answers.

**What a school can now do without a developer:** drill শ্রেণি ৯ → বিজ্ঞান →
সেকশন F → ৪০ জন; see which subjects nobody is teaching; assign a class teacher
or a subject teacher; replace one mid-year with a reason, keeping the record of
who was responsible until when; move forty students to another section with a
preview; run the year-end promotion through preview → plan → commit; publish
exam results; generate a month's invoices; create and deactivate staff
accounts; and set the notice-SMS length.

**Migration 041** fixed three things the schema could not do and one it lied
about: subject-teacher assignments had no validity period (so replacement was
an UPDATE and the previous teacher vanished); the class teacher had no history
at all; `it_admin` was in ops-svc's BRANDING_WRITERS allowlist and in this
document since R-1 but **not in the roles table**, so no user could ever hold
it and `app.has_role('it_admin')` could never be true; and
`audit.activity_log` had INSERT granted and no SELECT, so it could be written
and never read.

Assignment is now one operation for both cases — there is no moment when a
school knows in advance whether it is assigning or replacing — and the atomic
part lives in two SECURITY INVOKER SQL functions, because closing the old row
and opening the new one as two statements from the API leaves either a subject
with no teacher of record or two open rows, and the partial unique index turns
the second into an error later, for somebody else.

**The four D13 gaps are closed.** `POST /academics/publish` and
`POST /finance/generate` have callers; the notice-SMS cap has a write path
with a live segment count and a cost warning stated in multiples of the bill;
and the routine-solver discrepancy was investigated and **documented rather
than changed** — `/rms/generation` and `/rms/solve` are not duplicates (one
reads a produced routine, the other produces it), and building a second
timetable-generation entry point from the admin portal is precisely the
duplicate system Part K of the brief warns against.

**Browser acceptance found four things the 42 UI tests did not**: ISO dates
printed among Bangla numerals on the very rows where dates are the point; a
demo that showed a student the whole institution's structure because it skipped
a gate the server has; an invoice screen that drew a billing form for someone
who could not submit it; and a permission error rendered above an empty state,
saying "you may not see this" and then "there is nothing here". Running the
endpoints' SQL against a real schema found a fifth: `users.full_name_en` is
NOT NULL and the create-user endpoint inserted null, which would have failed on
the first teacher a Bangla-medium office added.

**Known limitations:**

- **Section and class creation are not in the UI.** R-3 assigns people to
  sections that already exist; `app.provision_tenant()` makes the classes and
  the pilot runbook makes sections by hand. A school opening a seventh section
  mid-year still needs the runbook. The largest honest gap in this phase.
- ~~**Guardian management is read-only.** The student drawer shows guardians and
  their fee authority; linking one, or changing `can_pay_fees`, has no screen.~~
  **RESOLVED in R-3's completion pass** (`guardian-panel.ts` posts a new link and
  patches `canPayFees`). This bullet survived here until D17's reconciliation on
  2026-09-01 found it contradicting §1 of this same file. **Unlinking is still
  missing** and is tracked as `B-7`.
- ~~**No audit viewer.** The log is now readable and R-3's mutations write to it,
  but F-1603's screen is not built — **backend complete, UI pending**.~~
  **RESOLVED in R-3's completion pass**: `audit-view.ts` exists and `audit` is in the
  navigation for principal and IT admin. Found stale by D17's reconciliation on
  2026-09-01. Export and actor-name resolution remain open as `B-11`.
- **`POST /rms/solve` stays API-only**, by the decision above.
- The bulk move is capped at 200 students per request; beyond that the honest
  tool is the import wizard.
- Invoice generation has no dry run, because the endpoint has none and a
  client-side estimate would be a second implementation of fee structures and
  waivers, disagreeing on exactly the students whose fees are unusual.

---

## 9f. R-3 completion pass — the three gaps R-3 named (closed)

R-3's own report listed three things it had not delivered. This pass delivered
them, and found something underneath.

**Class and section creation.** A school opening a seventh section mid-year no
longer needs the pilot runbook and a psql prompt. `GET/POST /ops/structure`
creates academic years, classes and sections; the forms live inside the
drill-down, so you create a section while looking at the class that needs one.

The class form deliberately offers **no academic year and no active flag**,
because `classes` has neither column — a class is a rung on a ladder ("নবম
শ্রেণি, বিজ্ঞান") and the year belongs to the section. The form says so, since
an absent field with no explanation sends an office hunting for it, and a
disabled field for a value nothing stores is worse: it tells them they set
something.

**Guardian linking and `can_pay_fees`.** The student drawer's read-only list
became a panel that links guardians, sets the relationship, and controls the
two permissions — which are not the same permission: `receives_sms` is who is
TOLD, `can_pay_fees` is who is ASKED FOR MONEY. The second is the column R-2's
`guardians_payers` audience resolves through, so
`db/tests/guardian_links.sql` asserts the wire itself: revoking it drops that
audience from 1 to 0, restoring it brings it back. Without that assertion the
screen could be a light switch wired to nothing, and nobody would find out
until a parent said they were never told about a fee.

The panel searches before it offers to create, and the server independently
links an existing person when a "new" guardian's phone is already in the
school. The failure it prevents is three rows for one father, one per child:
three SMS for every notice on the channel that is 80% of the bill.

**The audit viewer** (F-1603). Read-only, and structurally so — UPDATE and
DELETE stay revoked from the application role, so there is no write path to
expose. Filters are built from what the school has actually done rather than
from every action the code can emit. The diff shows **only the fields that
changed**, because twelve identical values with one difference among them is
how a reader misses the difference. Sensitive values are masked server-side on
the way out, to their last two digits — "changed to a number ending 47" is
what makes an entry useful.

### The gap the screens exposed

`classes`, `sections` and `guardianships` carried only the PERMISSIVE
`tenant_isolation` policy migration 010 applies in a loop to every table with
a `tenant_id`, plus a blanket GRANT. Complete tenant isolation, **no role
scope**: any authenticated session in a school could have inserted a class or
set `can_pay_fees` on somebody else's guardian.

It was harmless only because nothing wrote to those tables — sections came
from the runbook, guardianships from the importer. Migration **042** adds the
RESTRICTIVE write policies. Of twenty SQL suites exactly one noticed, which is
the measure of how unexercised that path was; that suite's fixture was
corrected rather than the policy widened.

DELETE is `USING (false)` for everybody on all three tables: a class or
section carries enrolment history and a cascade would take it, and unlinking a
guardian removes the record that they were ever responsible.

### What running it found

- The audit list's actor filter used `($3 = '' OR a.actor_id = $3::uuid)`.
  PostgreSQL evaluates the constant cast at plan time, so an empty filter threw
  *invalid input syntax for type uuid* — and the no-filter case is the DEFAULT
  view of that screen, so **every first load would have been a 500**. It
  typechecked; reading it did not reveal it.
- The full regression caught a genuine conflict rather than a broken test: the
  guardian panel showed phone numbers in a drawer any staff member can open,
  contradicting R-3's own privacy assertion. Fixed at the server — the
  endpoint now returns `phone: null` outside the three roles that may edit it,
  because returning it and hiding it in the UI leaves it in the response body.

**Known limitations:**

- **Editing an existing class or section is not in the UI.** 042 permits the
  UPDATE and no screen uses it; renaming a section or changing its capacity
  after creation still needs SQL. The largest remaining gap in this area.
- **Unlinking a guardian is impossible by design.** Correcting the permissions
  and the primary flag covers the real cases; a genuine data-entry error needs
  a support request.
- **No audit export**, and the entity id is shown raw rather than resolved to a
  name ("section 9e52…" rather than "সেকশন F").

---

## 9g. R-4 — the academic calendar (closed)

`calendar_days` has existed since migration 003 and had never had a screen —
while already being load-bearing: `services/sms-svc/src/dispatch.ts` reads it
twice to suppress attendance and notice SMS on holidays. A row in that table
already stopped messages reaching nine hundred guardians.

**No new table.** R-4 is mostly a read path over things that were already
true. Migration **043** added `description_bn`, `created_by` and timestamps,
relaxed the UNIQUE constraint (it was one entry per kind per day, so a school
with a sports day and a parents' meeting on the same Thursday could record
one of them), widened `notices.source_kind` by one value, and added the write
scope the table had always lacked.

### The gap, again

Third phase running. `calendar_days` carried only the PERMISSIVE
`tenant_isolation` policy migration 010 applies in a loop, plus the blanket
GRANT: complete tenant isolation and **no role scope**. Here it was worse than
on `classes` — **a student could have inserted one row with kind='holiday'
and silently suppressed the whole school's attendance SMS for that day**, and
the suppression query does not care who wrote the row.

The pattern is worth naming rather than rediscovering: 010's loop gives every
tenant table isolation, and role scope is added per-table by whoever builds
the feature. **Any table the product has only ever READ is still unscoped.**
R-5 should check before it writes.

### Decisions

**Exams are read, never copied.** The response merges `calendar_days` with
`exams.starts_on/ends_on` and `exam_subjects.exam_date` at read time, flagged
`editable: false`. A calendar row per exam would go stale the first time a
coordinator moved a paper. `db/tests/calendar.sql` asserts `calendar_days`
holds **zero** rows of kind 'exam' while an exam exists.

**No start/end time, deliberately.** Every consumer of this table is
date-grained — the SMS suppression asks "is this day a holiday", attendance
asks the same, the grid draws a day cell. A `start_time` nothing reads would
be a field the office fills in and no part of the product honours, which is
worse than its absence because they would plan around it.

**The weekend is `tenants.weekend_days`**, which already existed (0=Sun … 6=Sat,
default {5,6}, many Madrasah {5}). Nothing in the endpoint or the view
hardcodes Friday, and the browser test verifies two tenants shading two
different sets of columns from the same code.

**Deleting a holiday warns that the day's SMS resumes** — a consequence nobody
would guess from "delete".

### Offline, and real-time

**Reads offline, writes online.** The service worker caches
`/api/v1/ops/calendar` stale-while-revalidate, like the inbox and the routine.
Writes are NOT queued through the IndexedDB outbox: that outbox exists for
attendance and marks, which a teacher genuinely takes in a room with no
signal, and a queued holiday is one that silently suppresses SMS on a day
nobody has agreed to yet.

**No real-time push, and no infrastructure to reuse.** R-2 made the same call
for the notice bell — a polling timer on 2G costs more than the freshness is
worth. A calendar entry created while a guardian has the app open appears on
their next navigation.

**Known limitations:**

- **`working_weekend` — CLOSED by R-4.1.** It now overrides the weekly
  weekend: a make-up Saturday is a working day and its attendance and notice
  SMS go out. Holiday still wins on a contradictory date. The suppression
  logic, which existed twice, is now one exported function. **`ramadan_schedule`
  remains descriptive** — it would need to shift period times, which is a
  routine concern rather than a suppression one.
- No recurring events. ঈদ moves every year and a school enters its calendar in
  one sitting each January.
- No import of national holidays; every school types its own dates.
- The month view fetches one month per request, so a year overview is twelve.

## 9h. R-5 — branded print and the document engine (closed)

Six documents a school hands to a family, all on that school's letterhead,
all from one renderer: **fee receipt, report card, admit card, student ID
card, transfer certificate, attendance sheet.**

**One renderer, not six.** R-1's `brandedDocument` rendered a single page.
R-5 extracted the page shell into `docSection()` and added
`brandedDocumentSet()`, so one page and forty pages travel the same code path;
`brandedDocument` is now a one-section call to the set, and R-1's thirteen
tests pass unchanged. The six builders in `packages/ui-core/src/documents.ts`
are pure functions returning `{title, meta, bodyHtml}` — they know nothing
about tenants, HTTP or the database, which is what lets 45 unit tests assert
that two institutions never mix without starting a server.

**HTML, not PDF.** `GET /api/v1/ops/document` returns a printable document
and the browser's own Save-as-PDF makes the file. This is the master plan's
print-first stance, and it is why R-5 needed no object storage and puts
nothing large in PostgreSQL. When an R2/S3 credential lands, this endpoint's
markup is what gets rendered server-side; it does not change.

**Routine input ownership (P9-2).** `solve.ts` reads eleven tables and every
one of them now has a path a school can reach, except two that are
platform-owned on purpose. Institution-managed: bell times
(`period_definitions`), subject demand (`class_subjects.periods_per_week`),
teacher availability, teaching assignments, rooms, classes and sections.
Platform-managed: `tenants.weekend_days` and `tenants.shifts` — migration 069's
trigger refuses both from a school account, and the wizard shows the value
read-only and names shikhonBD rather than growing a control that would be
refused. Derived: `subjects`, seeded from the NCTB catalogue by
`provision_tenant`. Optional and still SQL-only: `teacher_competencies`, which
is a HINT in the assignment picker (a known teacher is marked, everyone else
stays choosable) and therefore gates nothing.

**Institution-wide generation (P9-3).** `POST /api/v1/rms/generate { yearId }`
is an ORCHESTRATOR, not a second solver: it runs the same `readiness()` the
wizard displays, finds or creates one DRAFT routine per shift the school's
sections actually run, and calls `RmsSolver` unchanged for each. Pressing
Generate twice is safe by two mechanisms — the newest draft is reused rather
than versioned up, and the solver tops up `periodsPerWeek − alreadyPlaced`.
`GET` re-reads prior runs from `routines`, so a refresh is not an empty page.

`hardConflicts` is **counted from the stored rows**, never assumed. The three
GiST EXCLUDE constraints make a clash unstorable only in an ACTIVE routine —
`rs_no_teacher_double_booking` and `rs_no_room_double_booking` both carry
`WHERE … routine_status = 'active'` — so a draft is protected on sections
alone. That gap is deliberate (two rival drafts of one shift must not block
each other) and `editor.ts:findClash` compensates for it in manual authoring;
`generate.ts` compensates for it here, with a window-function scan of the
drafts it just wrote.

**Measured, and the limit stated.** `scripts/routine-benchmark.mjs` seeds five
realistic institutions (20/40/80/120 sections; school, two-shift school,
college, madrasa) and drives the real handler. p95 server-side after P9-4:
1.29s / 2.40s / 5.03s / 6.78s / 1.98s, zero hard conflicts in every one.
These are LOCAL container numbers — no network, no TLS, no browser render —
so the product's "roughly one minute" promise is **not** proven end to end by
them and is not claimed to be.

**Routine editing, locking and undo (P9-5).** The editor is A4's, extended
rather than rebuilt: `place`, `assign`, `move`, `remove` and the three clash
sentences were already there, and the database's exclusion constraints remain
the arbiter.

`lock` / `unlock` write `routine_slots.is_pinned`, which has meant "the solver
may not move it" since migration 006 and had no writer. A pinned lesson is
selectable and not movable — refusing the selection, as the first version did,
left the unlock control unreachable.

`undo` reverses the newest edit from `routine_edit_log` (migration 074). The
inverse is computed when the edit is made, while the old row is still visible;
deriving it at undo time would reverse a row later edits had already moved.
Twelve steps deep, no redo, and nothing may delete an entry —
`edit_log_delete_scope USING (false)`, for everyone.

`requireVersion` refuses an edit made against a `row_version` the caller has
not seen. Optional, so callers predating it keep working; the editor always
sends one.

`ShellRoute.guardLeave` is how the shell asks a view whether it is safe to
leave. Two views had `hasUnsavedChanges()` and nothing called either.

**Measured:** the editor grid is flat as the school grows — p50 11 / 13 / 11 /
13 ms at 20 / 40 / 80 / 120 sections. It reads one section's week and an undo
stack capped at twelve, so nothing in it scales with the institution.

**Review and publish (P9-7).** `GET /api/v1/rms/publish?yearId=…` returns,
per shift, what would go live: total scheduled periods, sections, teachers,
pinned slots, hard conflicts, unplaced demand, soft violations, last
modified, the draft version, what publishing would replace, and the
blocking/warning findings in Bangla. `POST` carries `submit`, `withdraw` and
`publish`.

`routine_status` has held `review` since migration 006 and nothing had ever
written it — the fourth control in P9 that existed, was enforced, and could
not be reached. DRAFT → REVIEW → PUBLISHED now works, and a routine in review
stays invisible to the school: the status propagates to every slot and
`app.student_day` returns nothing, verified against the live database.

`src/publish-gate.ts` is the single gate. The review renders its answer and
the publish enforces it, so a screen saying "প্রকাশ করা যাবে" about a routine
the server would refuse is not expressible — a test exists whose only job is
that the two never disagree. Hard conflicts and an empty routine BLOCK;
unplaced demand and soft-constraint trades WARN and require one explicit
confirmation, which is then recorded in the audit row alongside what was
published. The gate does not replace the exclusion constraints, which still
hold under concurrency between the count and the UPDATE; it changes who the
coordinator hears it from.

**Removed:** an `unfilled` count returned since §8.1 and rendered by the
editor. `routine_slots` has carried `CHECK (slot_kind <> 'teaching' OR …
teacher_id IS NOT NULL)` since migration 006, so the set is empty by
construction — a tautology reported as a measurement, whose sentence only
`demo.ts` had ever made non-zero by hard-coding the state the schema forbids.

**Publishing is online only.** It cannot be queued: whether a routine may go
live depends on every other routine in the school at that instant, so two
offline devices could queue two publications that are each valid alone and
together are not. The action is disabled without a connection, with that
reason in a sentence; the review itself still reads.

**Printable routine (P9-9).**
`GET /api/v1/ops/document?type=routine_sheet&scope=…&id=…` → standalone
printable HTML on the school's own letterhead.

A seventh document type in R-5's existing machinery, not a print system: the
letterhead, watermark, signature, escaping, `@page{size:A4}`, unbreakable
table rows and repeating headers were all already there. No PDF library and no
server-side renderer — browser "Print → Save as PDF" from the same markup.

It imports `readTimetable` from rms-svc rather than re-deriving who may print
what, so the print path and the screen share one authorisation and one data
read. `status = 'active'` is the whole visibility rule, so draft, review and
superseded are unprintable without a check: they answer `409 not_published`.

**Orientation follows content**: portrait for section / teacher / room /
student (one lesson a cell), landscape for institution / class / group /
stream (a cell carries one line per section running that hour).

**A dense cell is one LINE per section** — `ক  গণিত · রফিক` — with the section
label in a fixed column so the eye runs down it. The first version gave each
lesson four lines (subject, class-section, teacher, room), so a four-section
class put sixteen lines in a cell and the grid compressed into a grey band.
The room came off the dense sheet to buy the fit: measured, it costs 11.2mm a
section with the room and 8.4mm without, which is one page against two. It is
still on the section's, the teacher's and the room's own sheets.

**The hour's ordinal counts TAUGHT hours.** `period_no` is a POSITION in the
day, not a count of teaching hours, and tiffin holds position 5 of the seeded
day shift — so `ordinalBn(period_no)` printed `৬ষ্ঠ` over the hour a school
labels `৫ম`, for the whole afternoon. Counting the taught rows gives ১ম–৭ম
with the bands consuming none, on the sheet and on the screen alike.

**The clock is the one Bangladesh reads.** `সকাল ১০:০০–১০:৪৫`, `দুপুর ১:৩০–২:১৫`
— the part of the day named once from the start, then a 12-hour range —
because `১৩:৩০` printed directly beneath a period ordinal is read as a period
number before it is read as a time. `formatClockRange` and `dayPartBn` carry
the everyday boundaries (ভোর/সকাল/দুপুর/বিকাল/সন্ধ্যা/রাত), so an evening
shift does not fall off the table.

**The year prints in the reader's numerals** (B-116). `num()` has done
locale-aware digits since R-5 and `date()` already used it — four builders
passed the year RAW past it, so a sheet read `শিক্ষাবর্ষ: 2026` beside
`সংস্করণ: ১`. Digits only, never the label: `2026-27` prints ২০২৬-২৭, a Bangla
label is untouched, and words a school typed survive. An English document
still shows the label as typed, deliberately.

**A section is a chip, a border, a rule and then a tint** — in that order,
because tint is what a photocopier loses first. Eight near-neutral tints, the
first pure white so the page has somewhere to rest. A page whose section
labels are all short uses them as keys; one long label (`ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা ও
ব্যবস্থাপনা বিজ্ঞান শাখা`) keys the whole page by numeral and prints a legend
carrying every name IN FULL. Nothing is truncated — there is no
`text-overflow` and no `line-clamp` in this sheet's CSS, and a test asserts
their absence.

**Breaks are on the page.** `period_kind` has seven values and migration 012
seeds সমাবেশ, টিফিন and জোহর into every school; the read ended
`AND pd.kind = 'teaching'` and threw them away. A break is now a band across
the full width of the grid, ruled top and bottom.

**A class too wide for a page splits into more CLASS pages**, never into
per-section pages, at N sections a page — N computed from the school's own
teaching-period count, because what fills a page is `rows × sections`. Every
page names its class and lists the sections on it. `board=1` is the
notice-board sheet: the same grid, larger type, and a cap that knows a 22%
larger face costs 45% more page.

**Sized in POINTS, not px** (2026-09-08). Chrome prints CSS at 96dpi, so
1px = 0.75pt and the first version's `font-size:11.5px` was **8.6pt** on A4 —
the teacher 7.9pt, the clock 7.1pt, 96% of every character below 10pt.
Subject is now 11.25pt, teacher 10.25pt, period 11.5pt, clock 10.25pt, day
header 12.5pt, class heading 16.5pt. **No routine content prints below 10pt**;
the 9pt residue is the page footer. A regression test reads those off the
shipped CSS in points.

Two findings came out of that work. `white-space:nowrap` had been dropped from
the period column, so every row's HEADER wrapped to four lines and set the
height of the whole grid — restoring it took a class page from 225mm to 121mm.
And with nowrap a narrow column CLIPS rather than wraps: the sheet printed
`সকাল ৭:৩০–৮:` with the rest outside the column, which no measurement caught
because clipping is not overflow. Only looking at the page did.

**Every sheet is landscape**, including section, teacher and room. A week is
six columns; portrait A4 gives ~30mm a day, which held a lesson at 8.6pt and
holds a third of one at 11.25pt — a portrait room sheet measured 303mm on a
297mm page. And **one section a page**: two need 24.4mm a row against 18mm
available, so the booklet splits at section boundaries rather than compress.

**Verified by rasterisation** (headless Chrome → PDF → PyMuPDF, both already
on the machine; nothing added to the repo). One document page is one sheet of
A4 on all 24 sheets — twenty across four benchmark profiles, four more across
four section-name lengths up to `ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা ও ব্যবস্থাপনা বিজ্ঞান শাখা`,
none with horizontal overflow. That capture is what found the real defect:
computed style said the page box was 297mm × 210mm and every class page was
still spilling onto a second and third sheet. It caught the notice-board
sheet a second time, 3.7mm over on an eight-period day.

| profile | sections | institution booklet | ms | kB |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| small | 20 | 10 pages | 41 | 104 |
| medium | 40 | 20 pages | 48 | 208 |
| large, 2 shifts | 80 | 40 pages | 65 | 420 |
| college, 2 shifts | 120 | 60 pages | 87 | 622 |

`CONTENT_SERVICE` maps it to nothing, like `id_card` and
`transfer_certificate`: there is no `routine` service to switch off, because
the timetable is what the school is.

**Also fixed for all seven documents:** the branding load now starts from
`tenants.name_bn`. A school that had never opened the branding screen was
printing the neutral "শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠান" placeholder on its own receipts,
report cards and certificates.

**Role-specific routine outputs (P9-8).**
`GET /api/v1/rms/timetable?scope=…&id=…` — eight audiences, one dataset.

`institution` · `class` · `group` · `stream` · `section` · `teacher` · `room` ·
`student`, each a WHERE clause over the routine whose `status = 'active'`.
One endpoint, one query, one response shape; a test asserts every scope's
lessons are a subset of the institution's.

Visibility is `status = 'active'` and nothing else, applied once in the read
every scope passes through — draft, review and `superseded` are all excluded
by it without being named.

Authorisation is per scope and asks the database, not the token:
`app.my_section_ids()` (which includes `section_subject_teachers`, so a
subject teacher's sections count), `app.my_ward_ids()` and
`app.can_see_student()` — the same functions the RLS policies use. A teacher
reads their own week and the sections they teach; a student their own section;
a guardian their ward's; the four administrative roles anything. `offered`
returns the scopes a caller may ask for, built from the same helpers, so the
picker cannot drift from what the server allows — and an omitted scope is
answered from that menu rather than from a default.

The student scope filters parallel blocks through `student_subjects`, exactly
as `app.student_day` does, so a child does not see the half of a split hour
they do not attend. The section's grid keeps both halves, marked.

**Not day-level.** This is the published WEEK. Substitutions for a date live
in `/rms/routine` and `/academics/myroutine`, which read `app.teacher_day` and
`app.student_day`.

**Replacing a live routine (B-108, closed after P9-7).**
`POST /api/v1/rms/generate { yearId, baseline?: 'inputs' | 'current' }`.

The solver's busy-set exempts the ACTIVE routine for the SAME shift — the
version being replaced, unique by `uq_routine_active`. Other shifts still
compete, and sibling drafts named by the caller still compete; only the
predecessor is exempt. Before this the solver counted the outgoing timetable's
teachers and rooms as taken and a replacement came back a fraction of the
original (560 → 193 on a 20-section school).

`baseline: 'current'` copies the live routine into the new draft — pinned
slots included — marks it `generated_by = 'copied'`, and lets the same solver
top up whatever the copy left short. It is refused when the bell schedule has
changed, because a copied slot's `period_definition_id` would then belong to
the old template. `'inputs'` is the default and is exactly what this endpoint
always did.

Publishing a replacement demotes the predecessor to `superseded` and promotes
the new one in ONE transaction, writing `supersedes_id`. The order is forced
by the unique index; the single transaction is what stops a failure between
them leaving a school with no live timetable at all. `supersedes_id` and the
`superseded` status had existed since migration 006 and had never been written
by anything.

**Measured:** a replacement places exactly what a first generation places at
20 / 40 / 80 / 120 sections; the clone path runs 7.4×–11× faster because the
solver meets a routine that is already full.

**Bangla numerals (B-108 §16).** `--font-bn-num` was declared in `app.css`
with its rationale and referenced zero times, so every Bangla digit rendered
in Hind Siliguri — where ১ is close enough to ৮ at UI sizes that "১০:৪৫" reads
as "৮০:৪৫" and "১২,৫০০.৭৫" as "৮২,৫০০.৭৫". A token could not have fixed it:
digits arrive inside sentences, not as elements, so the split is per character
via `@font-face` + `unicode-range: U+09E6-09EF`, sourced from `local()` only
(no download, no precache risk) and naming each platform's own Bangla face.
Measured: digits 186.76 → 218.41 px, letters unchanged at 101.67 px.

**The demo is its own bundle (B-109, closed in P9-7).** `demo.ts` was 94.1 kB
minified inside `app.js` — the largest module there, 10.7% of a bundle
budgeted at 180 KB gzipped for a phone on 2G. It is now
`apps/pwa/public/demo.js`, loaded by `await import('/demo.js')` on the one
path a demo visitor takes, with `/demo.js` marked `external` in the app build
so esbuild does not inline it back. **app.js fell from 184,721 to 159,352
bytes gzipped.** A production `/app` load never requests it — verified in the
browser. It is served stale-while-revalidate like `/app.js` (it has no
content hash, so `cache-first` would pin a visitor to their first demo build)
and is not precached.

**Scoped re-solve (P9-6).** `POST /api/v1/rms/resolve { routineId, scope,
preview?, fingerprint? }` recalculates one teacher, section, room or day.
There is no second solver: `RmsSolver` places `periodsPerWeek −
alreadyPlaced`, so removing the affected slots makes it place exactly those
back, around everything that stayed. The closure is the selected set and no
wider, because the solver only adds into free hours — it cannot displace a
lesson that did not move.

Pinned slots are excluded from the removal set, so they survive without a
"respect the pins" branch that could be forgotten. The removal and the
re-solve are one transaction (`solve({ client })`), so a failure leaves the
previous valid draft exactly as it was — and a PREVIEW is that same
transaction rolled back, which is the real solver rather than an estimate.

Concurrency is a whole-routine fingerprint, `count(*) || ':' ||
sum(row_version)`, checked inside the transaction. It is called a fingerprint
because two changes that cancelled exactly could agree; the exclusion
constraints remain the thing that cannot be fooled.

One undo entry per instruction (migration 075 widens the action CHECK).

**Measured against full generation** on the same benchmark schools, scoped to
one teacher: **9.6× / 9.5× / 21.5× / 48×** at 20 / 40 / 80 / 120 sections,
touching 4.8% → 0.9% of the timetable as the school grows.

**Client cache isolation (B-104).** The service worker's data cache is keyed
by school. `sw-router.ts:route()` flags every cached `/api/` decision
`tenantScoped`, at one place rather than on each branch, so a route added
later cannot ship unscoped; `tenantCacheKey()` puts the school in the key, so
a cross-tenant hit is not a check that can be forgotten — it cannot be
expressed. `auth.ts:authedFetch` sends `X-Tenant-Id` for the worker to key on;
`Authorization` cannot serve, because it rotates every fifteen minutes and a
cache keyed on it would miss on every refresh.

Alongside it, `local-data.ts:isTenantSwitch` detects a school change at boot —
at module top level, synchronously, and BEFORE `shikhon_tid` is overwritten —
and runs the existing B-8 purge. The key makes serving another school's data
impossible; the purge makes keeping it on the device impossible. Shell and
media buckets are deliberately unpartitioned: they are the product's own code.

The outbox needed no change. `OpOwner` is `{tenantId, actorId}` and
`ownedBy()` has filtered `claimBatch` and `counts` since it was written, so a
device holding two schools' unsent work has always kept them apart.

**Routine explainability (P9-4).** Four explainers, and only the fourth is
new. `api/generation.ts:explainSlot` answers "why this teacher, this room"
for a PLACED lesson (F-503); `src/soft-constraints.ts` lists every trade-off
with its cause where one is computable (F-505); `notEvaluated` names the
rules this build cannot check. `src/explain.ts` answers the fourth question —
why a demand was NOT placed — and it is a pure function, so its rules are
tested against hand-written failures rather than against solver output.

The solver's single `no_free_slot` became eight categories by RECORDING what
it already computed: `BlockerTally` counts which guard rejected each
candidate hour, written only where a candidate was already rejected, so no
placement decision changed. `IntervalBook` carries the shift that owns each
booking, which is what lets a cross-shift finding name the shift rather than
say "another shift".

**Claim → evidence is enforced, not intended.** Every sentence carries the
count and the denominator it rests on ("৩৫টি সম্ভাব্য সময়ের মধ্যে ৩০টিতে");
where the tally is empty the explanation says so and suggests nothing; a fix
is offered only when the school's own data supports it — a school with one
laboratory is told to add another, a school with four to move a class between
them, a school with none is never told to rearrange its timetable.

**Findings are grouped server-side.** An over-subscribed 80-section school
produced 1,516 rows; grouping on (category, subject) for demands and on the
rule for soft trades — and only after each category is decided, so a group is
one cause — brings that to 12. Every individual soft sentence is kept one
level in, because F-505's "nothing is silently accepted" still holds.

**The response carries only what the screen draws.** The blocker tallies and
the solver's full soft-violation list are consumed server-side and dropped:
375 kB → 70 kB on the 120-section college, 73 → 19 kB on the 20-section
school. Both are solver internals, which §1 says not to expose, and on a 2G
connection both were a cost paid for data nothing rendered.

**`src/presentation.ts` is the one place a machine identifier becomes
readable.** A map for the capabilities the schema names, a scrubber for
sentences composed and stored before anyone knew they would be shown, and a
deliberate fallback to "বিশেষ কক্ষ" for the codes an IT admin invents —
because `rooms.capabilities` is free text and a lookup that falls through to
the raw code is the bug itself.

**Two identifier contracts, and they are deliberately different (B-87).**
`student_profiles.student_code` is **generated** — `studentCodeFor(userId)` in
`import-run.ts`, `STU-` plus eight hex of the user's uuid — because a child
does not arrive holding a student number and a code derived from the id cannot
collide. `staff_profiles.employee_code` is **supplied**: the teacher CSV
importer refuses a file with no `employee_code` column and fails any row whose
cell is blank, because it is the school's own staff number and is already on
their paperwork. `POST /ops/users` now matches the importer — a blank code is a
400 naming the field, a duplicate is a 409 naming the field, and neither is a
500. Generating one would have given the same teacher two different codes
depending on whether they were typed or imported.

**Four refusals, four sentences (P-ops, B-84).** A 403 from any endpoint is
one of four different things, and support and the UI both have to tell them
apart: `forbidden` (this ROLE may not — a different person can), plain
`tenant_blocked` (the SCHOOL is suspended or in arrears — a payment, not a
colleague), and `tenant_blocked` carrying `serviceState: not_in_plan` (never
bought) or `disabled`/`maintenance` (switched off). The gate attaches
`serviceState` when the request named a service, on the refusal path only.
`refuseUnlessOk` reads it into `HttpStatus`, and `deniedMessage` /
`deniedContact` choose the wording and whether to offer a colleague at all.

**The document's SERVICE is not the same as `documents` (P-ops, B-53).**
The handler declares `service: 'documents'`, which is right for the printing
machinery — the letterhead, the branding, the page set — and wrong for the
content. A fee receipt is the finance module's data on a school's letterhead;
a report card and an admit card are the results module's; an attendance sheet
is the attendance module's. With each of those switched off, this endpoint
still returned a complete, branded, printable page — verified against a
running stack. `CONTENT_SERVICE` now maps each type to the service its content
belongs to and the gate is checked before a row of it is read.

It answers **403, not an empty document**: a blank sheet reads as "this child
has no record", which is a different and more alarming claim than "this school
does not run that module". `id_card` and `transfer_certificate` map to nothing
and still print — an identity card is the roster and a transfer certificate is
an administrative act about enrolment, and a school closing its finance module
still needs to send a child elsewhere.

**The tenant is not a parameter.** Branding comes from
`tenants.settings->'branding'` — R-1's source, no second table — read inside
`withTenant()` with no `WHERE` clause, because a session sees exactly one
`tenants` row. There is no tenantId in the query string, the body or a
header, so rendering on another school's letterhead is not something the API
can express. `db/tests/documents.sql` asserts both halves.

**What building it found.** `users_scope` (migration 010) ends with
`OR app.is_staff()`, because the staff directory is visible to staff. Since
every document is fed by `loadStudents`, which selects from `users`, a
**subject teacher could print a letterheaded admit card, report card or ID
card for any child in the school** — name, roll, parents, blood group — for a
section they do not teach. Marks would have been blank; the identity would
not.

Reading a name in a directory and printing an official document about a child
are different acts, so the printed surface is now deliberately tighter than
the directory: `loadStudents` adds `AND app.can_see_student(u.id)`, the
predicate that already existed for this exact question. The attendance sheet
is a *section* rather than a set of students, so it asks directly and returns
**403 rather than an empty grid** — a branded but blank register would have
looked like a working feature.

**Authorization** is a per-type allowlist. Money documents follow
finance-svc's `BILLING_ROLES`; result documents follow the publish gate plus
class teachers; the **transfer certificate is principal-only**, because it is
a legal statement about a child's record. The picker mirrors the list, so a
student is offered three documents and a principal six.

**No document URLs.** The preview is an iframe `srcdoc`, not a `src`: the
bytes arrive with the caller's bearer token and never become an address that
could be shared or replayed. The sandbox is `allow-same-origin allow-modals`
— `allow-scripts` is deliberately absent. Responses are `no-store, private`,
`nosniff`, `SAMEORIGIN`. Tenant admins get no CSS or HTML injection: branding
is a fixed set of typed fields and every interpolation is escaped.

**Print behaviour**, verified in a live document rather than in the source:
`@page {size:A4}`, a page break between documents, `table-header-group` so a
long table repeats its header on each sheet, `page-break-inside:avoid` on
rows and the signature block, and `@media print { body > .shell {
display:none } }` so the app chrome does not print.

**Degrading, not breaking.** A school on day one has no logo, watermark or
signature. No `<img src="">` is ever emitted: the signature becomes a gap and
a rule so the head signs by hand, and the ID-card photo is a labelled frame
reading ছবি. Neither falls back to another tenant's asset.

**Known limitations:**

- **One ID card per A4 sheet.** A section of 38 is 38 sheets to cut up.
  Several to a page needs a second page geometry, and a second print path to
  keep correct. A decision, recorded rather than hidden.
- **Money prints in Latin digits** (`৳ 1,300.00`) beside Bangla rolls and
  marks, because `formatBdt` is the product-wide money formatter shared with
  SMS and invoices. Consistent, but a real design question R-5 did not answer
  on its own authority.
- **No stored PDF and no student photos** until object storage lands.
- **CSV export**, listed beside documents in the plan's R-5 section, was not
  built. `toCsv()` still exists unused.

## 9i. R-6 — student search and the multi-year record (closed)

A principal types `STU-8F39A271` and gets রাফি হাসান, উত্তীর্ণ, with four
years of enrolment — each year holding the class, section and roll he
actually had that year.

**The history already existed.** `enrolments` has carried one row per student
per academic year since migration 003: section, roll, status, and the dates
the year opened and closed. R-6 reads it. There is **no history table**,
because a second copy of the truth would be a second thing to get wrong
during a rollover — and rollover already writes these rows.

**Migration 044 is one index and nothing else.** `student_id` was the last
column of the only existing `enrolments` index that mentioned it, so one
child's timeline walked the whole school's history. Measured on 2,000
students × 4 years: a seq scan of 8,000 rows at 1.255 ms, against **0.089 ms**
seeking four with `(tenant_id, student_id, academic_year_id)`. The scan grows
with every year the school stays open; the seek does not.

**Search is indexed because the query is classified first.** One `WHERE` with
six `OR`s reads well and cannot use an index, so `classify()` decides what was
typed and each shape gets the predicate its own index answers — the unique
code index, `uq_users_tenant_phone`, the two trigram indexes on names, and a
frank scan for board numbers, which have none. **No Elasticsearch**: every
shape answers in under 12 ms end to end, so the condition for adding one was
never met.

Two things measuring taught that reading would not have:

- `uq_users_tenant_phone` is a PARTIAL index (`WHERE phone_e164 IS NOT NULL
  AND deleted_at IS NULL`), and PostgreSQL will not use a partial index unless
  the query implies its predicate. Without `deleted_at IS NULL` the phone
  lookup seq-scans — 0.292 ms against 0.026 ms.
- `app.can_see_student` takes a row argument, so it costs a call per candidate
  row: 10.7 ms on a name search matching 166 students. `app.has_role(...)`
  takes none, evaluates once, and short-circuits the OR for management —
  **2.8 ms, the same 166 rows**. `users_scope` in migration 010 is written the
  same way for the same reason.

**Authorization reuses `app.can_see_student`** rather than adding a model, so
the role rules fall out instead of being enforced: management sees the school
including alumni, a teacher their own sections, a guardian their wards, a
student themselves. This **supersedes** the master plan's original R-6 line
("RLS keeps student/guardian out of the search endpoint") because the phase
brief asks for scoped guardian and student access — and scoping through the
existing predicate satisfies both readings at once.

**Fees are narrower than RLS**, the R-5 pattern again. `invoice_scope` reads
`... OR can_see_student(student_id)`, so RLS alone shows a class teacher every
family's balance in their section. The endpoint's list is tighter, and the fee
tab is not rendered disabled for them — it is not rendered at all, because a
greyed-out tab announces that a balance exists and they are not trusted with
it. Contact details follow R-3's line: withheld at the server, never sent, and
the screen says so rather than silently omitting fields.

**Six tabs, not the eight the brief listed.** A transfer IS an enrolment row
with `status = 'transferred'` and already appears in the timeline in the year
it happened; a certificate is generated on demand by R-5 and never stored.
Two empty tabs to match a list would have been worse than saying this.

**Performance, measured** on a seeded school of 2,000 students, 8,000
enrolments, 8,000 results, 15,240 attendance records, 200 graduates —
end to end through the handlers, p50/p95 over 20 warm calls:

| operation | p50 | p95 |
|---|---|---|
| search by student code | 4.6 ms | 6.3 ms |
| search by name (broad) | 11.9 ms | 13.1 ms |
| alumni filter, page 1 of 200 | 10.1 ms | 10.9 ms |
| alumni filter, page 8 (offset 175) | 10.5 ms | 12.4 ms |
| open one student, full history | 10.6 ms | 12.7 ms |

Pagination stays flat from page 1 to page 8. These are localhost against a
local PostgreSQL: they measure the database and the handler and nothing else,
and the round trip to Neon Singapore over a 2G link will dominate completely.
What they establish is that the queries are indexed and that more students and
more years do not degrade them.

**Known limitations:**

- **Board numbers are not indexed** — that shape scans one school's student
  table. Sub-millisecond at 2,000 students; a one-line migration if a school
  leans on it, not added speculatively.
- **The trigram indexes are not chosen at this size.** Verified usable with
  `enable_seqscan = off`; at 2,000 rows a seq scan is genuinely cheaper and
  the planner is right. They start winning as the table grows.
- **Multi-year attendance lives in `attendance_records_default`.** The table is
  range-partitioned by month with partitions only for 2026-08…2026-10, so
  earlier years fall into the default. The per-student query is an index-only
  scan there; worth knowing before someone adds partitions.
- **No type-ahead.** Search is submit-driven: on 2G a request per keystroke is
  a cost this product's own SMS-frugality argument says not to pay. The
  request sequencing is already in place if that changes.
- **No date-range filter on attendance** — per-academic-year totals are what a
  person reading a history wants.


## 9j. R-7 — tenant onboarding and the platform console (closed)

A shikhonBD operator opens `/platform`, walks a nine-step wizard, and a new
institution exists and is usable. No SQL. Measured end to end against a real
PostgreSQL: **249 ms** of server work for a school, **208 ms** for a madrasah.

**What was missing was the ability to insert a tenant at all**, and that was
by design. `tenant_self` is `USING (id = app.current_tenant())` and with no
separate `WITH CHECK` it governs INSERT too, so `shikhon_app` can only write a
tenant row whose id equals the tenant it is already inside. It cannot create a
school and cannot list one. Everything else R-7 needed had existed for
months: the columns since migration 001, `provision_tenant()` since 012,
`audit.platform_access` since 001, activation codes since 037.

**Three separate credentials, and a school holds none of them.** A
`super_admin` JWT (a `principal` token is refused); `PLATFORM_API_KEY`, checked
with a timing-safe compare and never in the browser bundle; and
`PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL`, a different database role. Unset, platform-svc answers
503 rather than falling back — a fallback to the runtime role is how a platform
endpoint quietly becomes a tenant endpoint. A wrong key and a missing key
return the same code.

**BYPASSRLS came off `shikhon_platform`.** Migration 001 gave it that flag back
when it was a role nothing could use. Leaving it on would have made the one
service that touches every school the one service where row-level security does
not apply — and `assertRlsEnforced` would have refused to start against it.
The cross-tenant functions are SECURITY DEFINER and work regardless; everything
else the console does is work inside ONE school under the ordinary policies. So
a bug in the wizard cannot write into the wrong school.

**The console is a separate everything**: page, bundle, service, database role,
credential. A school's device never downloads its code. It is also the one
surface besides the marketing site that **keeps** the shikhonBD brand — the D11
CI guard now runs three ways rather than two.

**The state the operator sees is derived, never stored.**
`app.tenant_onboarding_state()` counts real rows — years, grading bands,
classes, sections, subjects, fee heads, teachers, students, guardians, admins.
A stored stage column is exactly what goes stale when provisioning dies between
the act and the bookkeeping, which is the failure the recovery story is about.
The checklist renders a tick or a warning **and** the count **and** the note,
never colour alone.

**Only three things block activation**: an academic year, a grading scale, and
one administrator account. Everything else is a warning. The grading scale is
singled out because it is the failure that hides — without bands,
`app.compute_subject_grade` returns NULL and the year's first result
publication fails months later with no obvious cause.

### Three gaps this phase found, two of which would have stopped a pilot

1. **Nothing had ever written `student_profiles`.** R-6 built
   search-by-permanent-ID against `student_code` and no code path in the
   product had ever inserted a row — the table has held the permanent
   identifier since migration 001 and only test fixtures had put anything in
   it. The student import now creates the profile and the code.
2. **A provisioned school could not import a single student.**
   `provision_tenant` seeds everything except the `subject_templates` that
   F-304's `derive_student_subjects()` requires, so a freshly onboarded school
   rejected *every row* with `বিষয় তালিকা (টেমপ্লেট) তৈরি হয়নি`. The pilot
   runbook's step 6 would have hit the same wall.
   `app.provision_curriculum()` closes it, deriving templates from the
   `class_subjects` provisioning already seeds — it adds no curriculum
   knowledge, it reshapes what is there.
3. **`student_cap` was decoration.** Declared in migration 001, enforced
   nowhere. It is now a statement-level trigger on `enrolments` — statement
   level because an 800-row import is one INSERT — and the refusal states both
   numbers: *capped at 2 students and this would make 3*.

### Reuse, not reimplementation

The wizard needed three things that lived inside endpoints requiring a tenant
session the operator does not have. All three were **extracted**:
`src/import-run.ts` (the import orchestration, now also serving
`kind:'teacher'`), `src/activation.ts` (the code alphabet, length and HMAC —
three definitions that must agree exactly), and R-1's branding parser as the
console's validator. The alternative to each was either impersonating a school
or a second copy that would eventually disagree with the first.

### Two doors

`app.public_branding()` has accepted a slug OR a tenant id since migration 039,
so the subdomain needs no third identifier: `tenantKeyFromHost()` reads the
label and uses it as the key. `?tid=` keeps working and keeps **priority** — it
is printed on admission slips and baked into installed PWAs. Slug collisions
resolve with a district suffix, never a number, because this becomes the
school's web address.

**Known limitations:**

- **Wildcard DNS and TLS are not provisioned.** The resolver ships; pointing
  `*.shikhonbd.com` at the deployment and issuing the certificate is a
  deployment action. `?tid=` is unaffected.
- **Operator sign-in is two pasted secrets** in `sessionStorage`. No SSO, no
  key rotation UI — R-8 owns credentials.
- **`plan_code` is a label**; no feature gating. `student_cap` and
  `trial_ends_on` are enforced and shown, billing stays manual.
- **Trial expiry is not automatic** — the date is stored and displayed and
  moves nothing on its own.
- **The wizard's branding step is a subset** (colour, head teacher, phone);
  logo, favicon, watermark and signature stay in the school's own R-1 editor,
  where the school has the files.
- **Groups are not authored in the wizard** — a class's group comes from the
  NCTB template, and a school wanting Science and Humanities sections of class
  9 creates them in R-3's structure screen.
- **`activation_codes.issued_by` points at the account itself** for a school's
  first admin, because that column FKs to a person inside the school and there
  is nobody there yet. The operator's identity is in the platform audit row.
  Same division for `import_batches.started_by`.
- **platform-svc is the 11th of 12 functions.** One spare.

### P10 — the same console at 260 institutions (2026-09-08)

R-7 built the console against a handful of schools and P7 gave it operations.
Neither was wrong; both were built where `this.rows` WAS the fleet. At 258
tenants that assumption produced a screen where every number was computed
correctly from the wrong denominator.

**What an operator gets now.** `GET /platform/tenants` takes `page`, `size`,
`sort`, `dir`, `q`, `status`, `plan` and `attention`, and returns one page
plus a `page` object carrying the FILTERED total. The list is 15.1 kB instead
of 142 kB. Seven sort keys, whitelisted in the database through a CASE rather
than interpolated, with zero-padded numeric keys and an id tiebreak so paging
does not repeat or skip a school. A `size` above the cap is clamped
server-side; a sort key the database does not know is ignored rather than
honoured.

**The dashboard stopped counting the page.** `GET /platform/fleetsummary` is
one aggregate over the whole fleet — totals, access, billing, usage, quiet,
never-active and plan usage. Every stat card reads it. This is the part that
had to ship in the same commit as pagination: the moment `rows` is a page,
`rows.filter(...).length` is a lie that looks right.

**The attention queue is its own query.** It must show the most urgent schools
in the FLEET, which is not the most urgent on whichever page happens to be
open.

**`GET /platform/operators` · `POST /platform/operator`** — the operator
directory (**B-39**). A name per issued credential, no secret material, and
revocation enforced in `authorize()` on the next request rather than shown as
a greyed row. An unknown credential is allowed through deliberately: this
table names credentials, it does not issue them. `readAudit` LEFT JOINs it, so
the audit tab answers WHO for the first time — and still never ships the
actor's uuid.

**`POST /platform/identity`** — a school's own name, EIIN, MPO code, board
code and address, correctable without SQL. Three-state fields: absent means
leave alone, empty means clear, a value means set. **`slug` is not a
parameter** — it is install-link infrastructure, and changing it moves the
entry point of an already-installed PWA.

**Where the cost actually is.** Database time dominates and is linear in fleet
size, because the ranked base grades every tenant to decide which need
attention. Page size 25, database time only: 45 ms at 260 tenants, 81 at 500,
155 at 1000, 307 at 2000. **Those are mostly empty rows** — 241 of the 260
are leaked test fixtures (B-119) — and a real school costs about **3×** an
empty one: the 21 real tenants in that database cost 11.5 ms between them,
~0.5 ms each. Against real institutions, and with three such queries per
console load, that is **~150 ms at 100 schools and ~1.5 s at 1000**.
`OFFSET 250` costs the same as `OFFSET 0`. Handler work is about 5 ms on top;
the browser renders in 3.7 ms across a constant 1,225 DOM nodes. All of it
localhost with a warm cache, and it says nothing about what a school on a real
connection will wait. Recorded as **B-118**, trigger at **300–500 real
institutions**.

**Known and not fixed here:** no `apps/pwa` test file is type-checked
(**B-117**; measured at 113 errors to close, mostly a missing `@types/jsdom`),
and bulk cross-institution operations stay deferred (**B-40**) — P10 is the
phase that makes them tempting, and the natural first bulk action is
suspension.

### P11 — data portability (2026-09-08)

The gap the FINAL-OWNER audit called "the clearest customer-trust gap": there
was no export anywhere, and `toCsv()` had exactly one caller — the error list
for a FAILED import.

**What a school can now take.** Ten `GET …/export?dataset=…` endpoints across
academics, ops and finance: students, teachers, guardians, structure,
attendance, results, fees, notices, audit, and an offboarding manifest that
lists every dataset with its live row count and the address to fetch it from.

**Streamed CSV per dataset, no archive and no object storage.** B-17 stays
stubbed and untouched; nothing was added to make export look complete.
Streaming is genuine on Vercel and buffered on Netlify, whose adapter joins
written chunks at `end()` — stated in `csv-response.ts` rather than implied.

**Authorization narrowed rather than widened.** Principal, school owner and IT
admin; the accountant for fees alone. A class teacher reads their own roster on
a screen and cannot export the school.

**The tenant is `claims.tid` and nothing else.** The queries carry no tenant
predicate at all — `withTenant` sets `app.current_tenant()` and RLS decides —
so a handler that forgot a `WHERE` clause would still return only the caller's
school. A forged tenant in query, body-shaped params or headers returns the
byte-identical file, and the security probe asserts that by comparing bytes.

**Spreadsheet safety.** A leading `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab or CR is neutralised
unless the value is purely numeric — which keeps `-500` addable and keeps an
E.164 phone dialable through a round-trip.

**Known limits:** no stored artifact (by design), streaming real on Vercel
only, and the platform-operator fleet export is not built — the school-side
offboarding path is what shipped.

### Pre-pilot hardening (2026-09-08)

Four columns, because they do not agree:

| item | CODE | TEST | PRODUCTION |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scheduled jobs (B-50) | six systemd units + runbook in `deploy/` | monitor exercised; reports all three jobs "never run" | **NOT INSTALLED** — needs host access |
| Contact privacy (B-56) | one `maySeeContact()` gate | 7 tests, six roles, asserting the BODY | n/a |
| Guardian revocation (B-56) | PATCH refuses `link_revoked` | 7 tests, mutation-checked | n/a |
| Fixture leak (B-119) | teardown drops in tenant context | full suite: 21 → 21, zero residue | n/a |
| Suite invariant (B-66) | runner prints `13/13`, names silent workspaces | negative-tested | n/a |
| Lock timeout (B-36) | `SET lock_timeout = 90s` + watchdog | — | n/a |
| Session/device list (B-120) | `GET /auth/sessions`, `…/revoke`, `…/revoke-others` + নিরাপত্তা screen | 13 API + 2 SW tests; probe 44/44 | browser: revoked refresh 200 → 401 |

The one that blocks a pilot is the first row's PRODUCTION column, and it is
four commands in `deploy/shikhon-cron.md` rather than any code.

## 9k. R-8 — go-live unlocks (code closed; contracts open)

R-8 is the phase that turns things on. The surprise was how much of what it was
meant to turn on **did not exist yet**: the plan describes everything as "built
and dark", and three of its items had no implementation behind them at all.

- **There was no provider interface.** `sms_outbox` has had `provider`,
  `provider_msg_id`, `delivered_at`, `error_code` and `cost_bdt` since migration
  004, and the dispatcher had a `sendStub` that logged. Adding an aggregator's
  token to the environment would have changed nothing.
- **Nothing had ever written `delivered_at`.** In any deployment, ever. The
  product knew it had HANDED a message to a provider, which is not what a school
  is asking when it rings.
- **The OTP endpoint logged the code to the console.** With the switch a
  hardcoded `false` that was survivable. With the switch an environment variable
  it would mean an operator could enable login, see the readiness screen go
  green on OTP *and* SMS, and hand a school a login that delivered nothing.

### As built

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| `SmsProvider` seam — `StubProvider` (default), `SslWirelessProvider` | `services/sms-svc/src/provider.ts` |
| Delivery-report webhook, own secret, no tenant from the caller | `services/sms-svc/api/dlr.ts` |
| `app.record_sms_delivery` / `consume_ai_budget` / `settle_ai_budget` | `db/migrations/046_go_live_unlocks.sql` |
| Every switch, read from the environment | `packages/server-core/src/go-live.ts` |
| OTP queued to `sms_outbox` in the challenge's transaction | `services/identity-svc/api/otp-request.ts` |
| Budget reserved before the provider call; 402 on refusal | `services/ai-svc/api/index.ts` |
| `GET /api/v1/platform/readiness` + গো-লাইভ অবস্থা screen | `services/platform-svc/api/index.ts`, `apps/pwa/src/platform.ts` |

`resolveProvider()` **throws** when a provider is named without credentials
rather than falling back to the stub. A school that believes its messages are
going out is worse off than one that knows they are not.

The DLR has **its own** secret (`SMS_DLR_SECRET`), not `SERVICE_API_KEY`: a
vendor calls this endpoint, and giving a vendor the service key would make every
internal endpoint reachable by them. Unset it answers **503**, not 401 — an
unconfigured webhook and a wrong password send an operator to different places.
It takes no tenant from the caller; the row is found by provider message id and
the tenant comes from the row, via a `SECURITY DEFINER` function that updates
**only the four delivery columns**.

The AI budget is **reserved before the provider call** and settled after. A
check-then-record would let a school overshoot by however many requests are in
flight, and an AI bill is the one cost here that can run away between two cron
ticks. Refusal is 402, not 403: the school has done nothing wrong and the fix is
commercial.

### Verified, not asserted

Two deployments of the same binary against one database, walked in a browser:
switches off reports **৪ টি আবশ্যক সেটিং বাকি আছে**, switches on reports **সব
আবশ্যক সেটিং প্রস্তুত**, with no rebuild between them. A principal then logged
in for real — phone → code → `sms_outbox` → adapter → aggregator → session — and
the delivery report came back and marked the row `delivered` with
`cost_bdt = 0.3500`. That is the first time `delivered_at` has been written in
this product.

### Known limitations

- **No aggregator contract**, so `SMS_PROVIDER` is unset on every real
  deployment and the stub is what runs. The end-to-end proof used a fake
  aggregator on localhost, which proves the adapter and not the vendor.
- **`SslWirelessProvider` has never met the real endpoint.** It is written to
  one vendor's documented shape; the `csms_id`/`reference_id` mapping and the
  status vocabulary are the likeliest corrections on first contact, and both are
  isolated to `provider.ts` and the DLR's status map.
- **`cost_bdt` is only populated when a DLR reports it.** The send response
  carries no per-message cost and none is invented.
- **No SMS retry backoff.** A failed send stays `queued` with an `error_code`,
  retried each dispatcher tick up to 5 attempts, then `failed`. The tick is the
  interval.
- **The AI soft limit notifies nobody.** `soft_limit_notified_at` is stamped at
  80%; wiring it to R-2's notification infrastructure is not built, so a
  principal learns of it by being refused.
- **Operator SSO was expected here and is not built.** Console sign-in remains
  two pasted secrets (carried from R-7).
- **PII key, maintenance URL, MFS credentials, data residency and pilot schools
  remain open.** All are reported as not-done on the readiness screen; none can
  be closed by writing code.

## 9l. R-9 — web push notifications (one of seven R-9 items)

R-9 in the master plan is a list of seven post-pilot add-ons. One was built:
web push, the only one the plan gives a business reason for ("cuts SMS cost —
the biggest infra line") and the only one with **no external dependency**.
VAPID keys are self-issued; there is no vendor, contract or account.

The others are recorded as open in `docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md` §R-9, with which
are externally blocked (NCTB corpus, photo/voice, native wrappers) and which
are merely unbuilt (content authoring F-403, trend charts F-1505, section chat,
library/transport/hostel/payroll).

### As built

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| RFC 8291 encryption + RFC 8292 VAPID, in `node:crypto`, no dependency | `packages/server-core/src/web-push.ts` |
| `push_subscriptions` + `app.claim_push_subscription()` | `db/migrations/047_web_push.sql` |
| Subscribe / list / unsubscribe | `services/ops-svc/api/push.ts` (`/api/v1/ops/push`) |
| The push stage of the pipeline | `services/sms-svc/src/push-send.ts` |
| Service-worker `push` + `notificationclick` | `apps/pwa/src/sw.ts`, policy in `sw-router.ts` |
| The person's screen (`#/notifications`, every role) | `apps/pwa/src/notifications-view.ts` |
| The school's opt-in | `apps/pwa/src/admin-settings-view.ts` → `ops/settings` |
| Key generation | `scripts/generate-vapid-keys.mjs` |

No new Vercel function: `push` mounts on ops-svc's dispatcher, so the Hobby
plan's one spare slot (11 of 12 used) is still spare.

### Three decisions worth knowing

**The endpoint is globally unique across tenants, and that is a security
property.** A push endpoint identifies a *browser*, not a person: two users at
two schools sharing one device and origin get the same one. Two coexisting rows
would put school A's notices on school B's parent's lock screen. Claiming an
endpoint deletes the previous owner's row — necessarily cross-tenant, which is
the entire reason `app.claim_push_subscription()` is SECURITY DEFINER. It takes
no tenant or user argument; both come from the session.

**Not even the principal can read a subscription.** A deliberate departure from
every other table: management can see who received a notice, but an endpoint is
a *capability* — whoever holds it can put a notification on that phone — and no
question the office answers needs it. The API returns a 12-character
fingerprint, never the endpoint.

**Push is tried first and the SMS cancelled second.** A failed push therefore
costs milliseconds and the SMS still goes; the reverse order loses the message
whenever push fails. Suppression is opt-in per school
(`settings.push.replacesSms`, default off), and an emergency notice or a login
code is never suppressed at all.

### Verified

RFC 8291 §5's published vector matches byte for byte. End to end against a real
HTTP push service, the notice was encrypted, signed with a real VAPID header,
received and **decrypted back to `{"title":"নথি বিদ্যালয়","body":"আগামীকাল
বিদ্যালয় বন্ধ থাকবে।"}`** — with the SMS row marked `suppressed` /
`delivered_by_push` and no other tenant able to see the subscription.

### Two defects found, one older than the phase

- **`navigator.serviceWorker.ready` never settles when registration fails**, so
  the notification screen loaded forever on any browser that blocks service
  workers. Fixed with `getRegistration()` on the read path and a bounded race
  on the subscribe path.
- **`jsonb_set(settings, '{sms,noticeMaxChars}', …, true)` was a silent no-op
  when the parent key was absent** — a pre-existing R-3 bug. On every freshly
  provisioned school the settings PUT returned 200, the screen said সংরক্ষিত,
  and nothing was written. Fixed with a `||` merge; `ops-svc/test/settings.test.ts`
  is the endpoint's first test file.

### Known limitations

- **Never handshaken with a real push service.** FCM/Mozilla/Apple have not
  seen a message from this code; verification is the RFC vectors plus a fake
  service. First-contact risk is concentrated in the `applicationServerKey`
  encoding.
- **A real `pushManager.subscribe()` was not exercised** — the automation
  browser denies notification permission by policy and blocks SW registration.
  The browser's half was stood in for by a script using the same P-256
  handshake.
- **No retry for a transient push failure.** A 5xx leaves the row queued and the
  SMS goes, which is safe and also means a momentary outage costs an SMS.
  `failure_count` is stored and unread.
- **`last_success_at` means a push service accepted it**, not that anyone saw
  it — the same distinction R-8 drew for SMS.
- **No per-notice channel choice**: a school opts in for everything or nothing.
- **iOS requires the app on the Home Screen** before Safari allows web push. The
  screen reports `unsupported`, which is accurate but does not explain the step.
- **DNS rebinding is not defended against.** The SSRF guard refuses IP literals,
  non-https, URL credentials and internal-looking names; a public hostname
  resolving to a private address would still be fetched.

## 9m. R-7 completion pass — onboarding that reaches attendance (closed)

§9j records R-7 as closed. It was not: the wizard built a school correctly and
the school could not then be used. This pass walked the whole documented path —
onboard, activate, sign in as five roles, take attendance — and closed seven
defects, three of them older than R-7.

### What was wrong

| # | Defect | Age |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Screen 1 asked for "প্রতিষ্ঠানের ধরন" and offered teaching **mediums**. The four supported types were not selectable; মোহাম্মদপুর কলেজ was stored `stream=madrasah` and listed as মাদ্রাসা | R-7 |
| 2 | Screen 7 created **one** admin and advanced — a school needing a principal *and* an IT admin needed SQL | R-7 |
| 3 | The wizard was **not resumable**: its only entry cleared `tenantId` and started a new school | R-7 |
| 4 | Import lost the chosen file between "যাচাই করুন" and "আমদানি করুন" — `render()` rebuilt the input | R-7 |
| 5 | The importer rejected `অভিভাবকের মোবাইল`, the exact column its own hint asks for | R-7 |
| 6 | **A College could not take a single student.** The NCTB catalogue stopped at class 10, so classes 11–12 provisioned with zero subjects and every import row failed the fourth-subject rule | migration 012 |
| 7 | **No real user could save attendance.** The screen carried a hardcoded `academicYearId: 'yr-2026'`; sync rejected every save with `invalid input syntax for type uuid`, and `/sync/push` returns 200 with the rejection in the body | pre-R-7 |

Defect 1 survived because `apps/pwa/src/platform.ts` — the nine screens that are
the only way an institution comes into existence — **had no test file**, and
could not have one: it called `matchMedia` at module scope. It has 21 tests now.

### What was added

- `apps/pwa/src/institution-type.ts` — the four types **derived** from
  `stream` + `level` rather than stored, since those two columns already carry
  the fact.
- Migration **048**, seeding higher-secondary subjects (compulsory, the three
  groups, and an আলিম core). Reference data only — `provision_tenant` already
  reads this table by stream/level/group.
- `POST /api/v1/platform/plan` — plan, cap and trial end were writable once, at
  creation. A school that outgrew its cap needed SQL, and the over-cap refusal
  named a limit nothing in the console could raise. A cap below current
  enrolment is refused with both numbers.
- **Activation codes for staff** on the users screen. `activation_issue_scope`
  always allowed it and only the student roster offered it, so the IT admin the
  console had just created could not be given a code through any UI —
  *Backend complete, UI absent*, on the account a new school needs first.
- **The activation door is always offered.** It rendered only when OTP was off;
  with OTP on, a principal holding a printed code had no way in — R-7's own exit
  criterion, failing wherever OTP works.
- `resumeStepFor()` — the way back into the wizard, naming the step that is
  actually missing.

### Verified in a browser

Two institutions onboarded through the console, no SQL after the wizard began:
**মনিপুর স্কুল** (বিদ্যালয়, secondary, `#1b5e20`, 5 classes / 10 sections / 36
subjects / 10 students) and **মোহাম্মদপুর কলেজ** (কলেজ, higher_secondary,
`#7b1fa2`, 2 / 2 / 13 / 3) — different type, level, colour, head teacher,
structure and roll.

Five roles signed in with codes issued through UI surfaces (principal, IT admin,
teacher, student, guardian — the guardian seeing **both** children who shared one
phone number in the CSV), and the teacher saved attendance:
`applied · records: 2 · smsQueued: 1`, in Tenant A only.

Cross-tenant, attempted rather than assumed: platform API 403 even **with** the
platform key; B's section and student by id → 404 (not 403 — no existence
disclosure); name search → 0 results; `x-tenant-id` header ignored; `?tid=<B>`
leaves the session in A; a sync push naming B → `TENANT_MISMATCH`.

Student cap enforced and **recoverable through the UI**: over-cap import refused
with both numbers and nothing partial written; lowering the cap below the roll
refused; raising it let the blocked import complete.

### Known limitations

- The higher-secondary catalogue is a **starting set**, not the full syllabus,
  and its `nctb_code` values are ours rather than the board's — the subject set
  and group structure are stateable, the exact paper codes are not, and the
  existing codes in that table are SSC papers that a `combined` school would
  collide with.
- The student-cap refusal reaches the operator **in English**, raw from the
  database trigger.
- The console's admin endpoint grants a role to an existing phone number and
  reports `reused: true`. That is how a code is reissued, and it also means
  typing a teacher's number with "principal" selected quietly promotes them. It
  should name the person and ask.
- Teacher→subject assignment is still per-section by hand.
- `has_branding` measures `logoUrl`, which the wizard cannot set; the checklist
  row is now labelled **লোগো** so it says what it measures.
- Wildcard DNS/TLS, operator SSO, trial-expiry automation and plan feature
  gating remain open from R-7.

## 9n. R-8 production closure pass — the machinery for evidence (R-8 still OPEN)

**2026-08-30.** Everything in R-8 that is code is now done. Nothing in R-8 that
requires the outside world has been done, because none of it can be done from a
repository: there is no production deployment, no aggregator contract, no
production database, no real device and no school.

What this pass added is the machinery that will *record* those things, built so
it cannot be satisfied by intent.

| Built | What it does | State |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/preflight.mjs` | 32 checks over env, secrets, database separation, roles, origins, bundles, cron, SMS, VAPID, plus 11 externally-attested items | Runs; exits 1 on this deployment |
| `docs/production-evidence.json` | The human half: `status`/`date`/`environment`/`evidence`/`result` per external item | 9 of 11 null |
| `scripts/restore-drill.mjs` | Backup → isolated restore → compare every schema object, table and tenant → RTO | **Passes on local Docker.** Not production |
| `scripts/security-probe.mjs` | 29 live checks over 12 areas, positive and negative | **29/29 against a running deployment.** Not production |
| `scripts/pilot-report.mjs` | Per-school pilot record from real timestamps | Runs; **0 designated pilots** |
| `packages/server-core/src/onboarding-metrics.ts` | Onboarding duration derived from `audit.platform_access` | Shown in the console per school |
| `docs/PILOT-ONBOARDING-RUNBOOK.md` §13–18 | Pilot selection, the evidence tables, the HSC conversation, blockers | **Appended** to the existing manual runbook; every table empty |

### The environment field is what keeps this honest

The preflight compares an attestation's `environment` against the deployment
being checked, and a mismatch reads as UNVERIFIED. So the restore drill —
genuinely executed, genuinely passing — does **not** close the production
restore gate; it reports as "attested against local-docker, NOT production — a
rehearsal elsewhere". That distinction is the entire point of the mechanism.

### Defects found and fixed during the pass

- The restore drill's own comparison matched tenants **by display name**, and
  two schools on the development database are both called মোহাম্মদপুর কলেজ. It
  reported a phantom mismatch. Two real schools sharing a name is ordinary in
  Bangladesh; it matches by id now.
- The pilot report summarised **every** tenant, so it duly reported "median 61
  min" from the author's own browser walks. Nothing counts now unless it is
  named in `PILOT_TENANT_IDS`.
- The console rendered a principal who signed in *during* setup as
  **"-১৭ মিনিট পরে"**. Negative is normal and is a good sign; it now says
  সেটআপ চলাকালীনই.
- A seeded tenant rendered as **"০ মিনিট"** — the prettiest lie available on
  that screen, and exactly the number somebody would later quote as evidence
  for the under-an-hour target. The server now marks it synthetic.

### Verified, and where

- Restore drill: 121 tables, 355 indexes, 227 RLS policies, 27 table counts and
  8 tenants identical after restore. RTO 4.0s on 2.6 MB. **local-docker.**
- Security probe: 29/29 — tenant isolation by header, id, query and body;
  a cross-tenant *write* refused; RLS verified at the database with no runtime
  role holding SUPERUSER or BYPASSRLS; 7 SSRF vectors refused; no secret in any
  bundle; CORS; per-phone OTP limiting. **local-docker.**
- Settings round-trip: written, re-read after a fresh request, confirmed in the
  database, and unreachable from another tenant by body, header or query.

### Still shut

Production deployment · wildcard DNS/TLS · real SMS delivery · real push to a
device · production backup and restore · an alert reaching a human · 3–5 pilot
institutions · real users · a real offline test.

R-9's pilot gate remains **unsatisfied**.

---

## 9o. R-8 external-dependency mode (R-8 still OPEN)

**2026-08-30.** The repository side of R-8 is closed and accepted. What remains
cannot be built: a hosting account, a domain, an SMS aggregator contract, an
alert destination, a production database, a browser with a person at it, and
3–5 schools.

The forward-looking checklist lives in
[12-PRODUCTION-RUNBOOK.md](12-PRODUCTION-RUNBOOK.md) §0a — eight groups, every
box unticked, each naming the `production-evidence.json` key that records it.

| External item | State | Evidence key |
|---|---|---|
| Production deployment | not attempted | — |
| Wildcard DNS / TLS / subdomain routing | not attempted | `wildcard_dns`, `wildcard_tls`, `subdomain_routing` |
| Real SMS delivery | not attempted | `real_sms_delivery` |
| Real push delivery | **blocked 2026-08-30**, reason recorded | `real_push_delivery` |
| Backup configured / restore drill | rehearsed on `local-docker` only | `backup_configured`, `restore_drill` |
| Human alert received | not attempted | `alert_delivered` |
| Real offline test | not attempted | `pilot_offline` |
| Pilot onboarding | not attempted | `pilot_onboarding` |
| Cross-tenant probe in production | rehearsed on `local-docker` only | `prod_cross_tenant` |

**The rule for this mode:** no fake substitute may be built to turn a gate
green, and no external item may be marked complete from configuration intent.
R-8 stays OPEN for as long as the prerequisites are genuinely unavailable —
which is a correct state, not an unfinished one.

The cheapest remaining gate is push: one ordinary browser, one click, no
contract and no deployment.

---

## 9p. R-8 repository-only cleanup audit (R-8 still OPEN)

**2026-08-30.** An audit of what can be fixed without leaving the repository.
No external gate moved.

### Fixed

| Finding | Severity | What it was |
|---|---|---|
| `tsc` failing since R-9 | **MUST FIX** | 10 errors across 3 tsconfigs. `node --test` strips types, so the suite was green while CI's type gate was red for six commits |
| Stale login error | **MUST FIX** | `this.error = ''` on a class with no `error` field — the phone-number error followed the user onto the activation-code screen |
| Demo sections missing `academicYearId` | **MUST FIX** | The same shape as R-7's real attendance bug, in `?demo=1` |
| Unpinned `lucide@latest` on the marketing origin | **SHOULD FIX** | Third-party script, mutable, executing on shikhonBD's own domain. Now pinned + SHA-384 SRI |
| README: "Built and deployed" ×7 | **MUST FIX** | Nothing is deployed. Checking it also surfaced a **stale public deployment** at `shikhon-lms.vercel.app` |
| Three money formatters | **MUST FIX** | Fees screen showed ৳ ১,২৫০ while the receipt for the same invoice showed ৳ 1,250.00. One formatter now; `en-IN` lakh grouping decided |

### Classified, not implemented (all are new features)

Class/section edit UI · guardian unlink · audit export · object storage · CSV
export · multi-card ID layout · attendance date-range filter ·
board-registration index (confirmed a seq scan; fine at pilot size, and an
index costs write throughput on the student import).

`GET /sync/pull` is **reclassified from bug to unused capability** — built,
mounted, tested, working, no client. It stays.

### Gates after the audit

1160 tests with a database · 26/26 DB suites · **TypeScript 0/0/0** · 48/48
migrations · D11 · parameter-property guard · secrets clean over 136 commits ·
security probe 29/29 · browser acceptance on the pinned CDN and the fees screen.

## 9q. UI/UX audit — the design system was never applied to `/app` (2026-09-01)

**Audit only; nothing redesigned.** Full reasoning in the 2026-09-01 entry of
[PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md).

### Three generations, not two

| Gen | Location | Primary colour | Reach |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — legacy | `app.css` `--c-*` | original | **373 selectors** (most of `/app`) |
| 2 — partial pass | `app.css` `--color-*` | `#e53935` | ~30 selectors (login, home, buttons, card, branding, notices) |
| 3 — Ata Ekta | `design/tokens/*.css` | `#D23B2E` | `/design` only |

Gens 2 and 3 use the **same names with different values**. No Ata Ekta colour
appears in `app.css`. The token file says the red was deepened because
`#e53935` fails WCAG AA — the design palette is a **correction to the one
`/app` still ships**.

### Status by surface

| | `/design` | `/app` |
|---|---|---|
| Screens | 66 (32 desktop/mobile pairs) | ~37 routes |
| Desktop layout | `.dnav` sidebar, 9 `dpage-*` | **none** — one `min-width:900px` rule, for the branding editor |
| Mobile layout | `.phone` + `.bottomnav` | `shell-tabbar` (used at all widths) |
| Real data | **1 fetch** (branding) — a mockup | 26+ views on real APIs |
| UX states | none | loading / empty / error present in most views |
| Dark mode | **none** | 122-line palette (F-1607) |
| Tech | plain HTML/CSS + `.jsx` kit (React not a dependency) | framework-free TS (D1) |

**Shared already:** `--tap-min: 48px`, `Hind Siliguri` / `Inter`, and the
`--font-bn` token name.

### D13 consequence

`/app` is not "UI complete". It is **functionally** complete on most screens and
**visually** on the older system, with no desktop layout at all. The UI is
reported as **in progress**, not done.

### Not lost

Nothing under `design/` was ever deleted. `index.html` → `design.html` and
`index.legacy.html` → `app.html` were renames (R-1-A).

## 9r. UI migration P0 — the Ata Ekta token foundation (2026-09-01)

**Delivered. P1 not begun.** One file: `apps/pwa/public/app.css`.

`--c-*` proved to be a pure alias layer, so the palette moved by re-pointing 29
tokens — **424 usages and every view module untouched**.

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Brand | `#e53935` — **4.23:1, fails AA** | `#D23B2E` — 4.77:1 |
| Page ground | white | Muslin `#F1EFE6` (cards stay white) |
| Text | `#1f2937` cool grey | `#53443D` Clove |
| Dark ground | `#1a1817` cool | `#1B1714` warm Clove |
| Type scale | px ladder only | canonical **names** mapped onto it — 16px Bangla floor kept |
| Legacy `--c-*` | 29 defs / 424 uses | unchanged; now resolve to Ata Ekta. Retired in P8 |

**Contrast:** 956 rendered element-checks across 12 routes × 2 themes, **0
failures**. Five canonical hues needed a darker `-text` step to clear AA on
Muslin (warning was 2.95:1); hue kept, step moved.

**Found and fixed:** `.system-row` is a `<button>` that never set a background,
so it inherited the UA button face — `#6B6B6B` in dark, 2.59:1. Pre-dated P0.

**Gates:** 1172 tests · TS 0/0/0 · 26/26 DB · D11 · security probe 29/29 ·
tenant A/B verified · no overflow at 1440/1024/390/375 · +2.6 KB gzipped.

**Still true:** `/app` is mobile-first at every width. The desktop shell is P1.

## 10. Gap list → what's next

Mapped to the phasing of [05-DELIVERY-ROADMAP.md](05-DELIVERY-ROADMAP.md). The
2026-08-07 feature build closed the API-surface gaps for exams/marks, fees, AI, ANS and
substitution — what remains is mostly credentials, content, and follow-on UI:

| Gap | Blueprint ref | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Provider adapter + DLR webhook + the login switch~~ — **closed by R-8** (§9k). What remains is the **aggregator contract itself**, which no code can close | 03 §3 | 1 |
| Guardian absence-notification flow end-to-end — enqueue, dispatch, provider adapter and delivery reports all ship (R-2, R-8); it reaches a real phone when an aggregator is configured | 01 §3 events | 1 |
| Attendance correction flow + absence-SMS grace window | 01 §2.6 | 1 |
| MFS merchant credentials + per-provider initiation calls + signature verification (endpoints + webhooks exist; `pay` kill-switched) | 03 §2 | 2 |
| ~~Report-card rendering~~ — **closed by R-5** (§9h): prints on the tenant letterhead, singly or a section at a time | 05 Phase 2 | done |
| Object storage (S3/R2) for stored receipt PDFs, student photos and answer scripts — R-5 deferred it and works without it | 01 §7 | 2 |
| CSV export endpoints (`toCsv()` exists, unused) — listed under R-5 in the plan, not built | 05 Phase 2 | 2 |
| Set `DATABASE_MAINTENANCE_URL` in Vercel so the nightly maintenance cron goes live | 06 §5 | now |
| CP-SAT solver upgrade; coordinator routine-editing UI (substitution finder ships now) | 02 §3 | 3 |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + NCTB corpus ingestion + embedding service → upgrades AI from disabled/lexical to grounded hybrid RAG (gateway ships now) | 01 §6 | 3 |
| ANS: register real endpoints (`ans_endpoints`), KMS for per-endpoint signing secrets (batch pull, dispatcher, inbound staging ship now) | 03 §4 | 4 |
| Answer-script photo pipeline | 01 §2.7 | 2–3 |

| ~~Web push to cut SMS cost~~ — **closed by R-9** (§9l): a delivered push can cancel the same message's SMS, opt-in per school | 05 R-9 | done |

| Content authoring workspace (F-403) — **the last open P0**, code-only. Every consumer of content is built; the producer is not | 09 audit | R-9 remainder |

| Report trend charts (F-1505) — code-only, unbuilt | 09 audit | R-9 remainder |

| Section chat — optional per the master plan; a child-safety design problem first | 11 §R-9 | R-9 remainder |
| ~~AI per-tenant token budgets (`ai_budget_periods` enforcement)~~ — **closed by R-8** (§9k): reserved before the call, 402 on refusal. Answer-leak detector still needs embeddings | 01 §6.3 | 3 |


## P1 — application shell (2026-09-01)

`/app` has a real desktop layout for the first time. Persistent grouped sidebar
at ≥1024px (68px icon rail at 1024–1279), breadcrumb + search + bell + profile
menu in the topbar, content column capped at 1200px; below 1024px the mobile
shell keeps its bottom bar, now carrying **five role-chosen tabs** instead of
the first five registered routes.

`/demo` is its own address. `/app` logged out is the **login screen** — it used
to enter demo mode automatically whenever OTP login was disabled, showing a
logged-out teacher fabricated students under their own school's name.

Unchanged: database, API, RLS, auth, tenant resolution, attendance, marks,
notices, SMS, push delivery, calendar, finance, documents, onboarding, and
every view module. 1,224 tests, TypeScript 3/3, 48/48 migrations.

Not yet done: the screens themselves (P2–P6) — dashboards, tables→mobile lists,
the shared page-header, and the component library.


## P2 — component system (2026-09-01)

`apps/pwa/src/ui/` — Card, StatCard, PageHeader, Breadcrumb, Button, IconButton,
Input/Select/Textarea (FormField), SearchField, FilterBar, Badge, StatusBadge,
Tabs, DataTable + MobileList + ListItem, Pagination, Timeline, Modal/Drawer/
BottomSheet (one focus trap), ConfirmationDialog, Toast, EmptyState,
ErrorState, PermissionState, LoadingSkeleton, ListSkeleton, InlineLoader,
ProgressIndicator, Tooltip, Avatar, FileUpload.

One declaration produces both a desktop table and a mobile list. `pageHeader()`
adopted in 18 views (byte-identical DOM). 91 component tests.

Not built: DatePicker (native `<input type="date">` is better), charts
(server-rendered SVG per 04-UIUX §6), any component taking a colour.

Backend, APIs, RLS, auth and every workflow: unchanged.


## P3 — teacher experience (2026-09-01)

Teacher dashboard (new, data-driven from `/rms/routine?scope=day`), attendance
(section + roster loaded from the server, 13 states, retry, double-submit
guard), roster (shared DataTable → MobileList), routine (tab strip,
self-explaining substitutions), marks (save guard, read-only explained),
scripts (named pickers instead of UUID text boxes).

Removed: a fabricated `{ id: 'demo-section', labelBn: '৯-ক', academicYearId:
'yr-2026' }` fallback, 60 placeholder students, and two dead loader helpers.

Unchanged: the outbox/save/sync path, the RMS solver, script compression and
storage, every API, RLS, and authorization.

**Offline:** queue durability is proved in `packages/offline` (46 tests); the
UI for its states is proved by 19 new tests. The full browser→server→database
round trip is **not** proved — it needs a seeded tenant, and is the same gate
the pilot closes.


## P3.1 — stability gate (2026-09-01)

`ward.test.ts` fixed: its fixture assumed four consecutive days share a
calendar month, so it failed on the 1st–3rd of every month against a
month-to-date metric. Production contract unchanged; fixture anchored to the
current month and verified across every edge date.

Attendance tiles no longer announce "undefined": the roster returns
`fullName: { bn, en }`, not `nameBn`. A P3 regression, caught by the browser.

DB suite **1,334 passing, twice**. Non-DB 1,039. tsc 3/3. 48/48 migrations.
D11 52/52. `index.html` byte-identical to the deployed commit.

## P4 — student + guardian experience (2026-09-01)

Student home is new (`student-home-view.ts`, four independent fetches). The
guardian home moved onto the P2 components with its cache-first behaviour
intact. `ui/child-selector.ts` is the new shared component: nothing for one
child, an inline strip for two or three, a button and a sheet beyond that.

**Privacy is tested, not asserted.** `services/academics-svc/test/p4-privacy.test.ts`
runs 11 cases against real RLS across two tenants — student self-scope,
guardian child-scope, and cross-tenant refusal, each with its negative.

Three defects worth recording:

- `DEMO_STAFF_ONLY` listed one path; `requireStaff` guards seven. A guardian
  in the public preview could open a class register. `apps/pwa/test/demo-gate.test.ts`
  now derives the expected list by scanning `services/*/api` for
  `requireStaff(claims)` on a GET, so a new endpoint cannot silently be open
  in the demo.
- The read-through caches are `shikhon_*` localStorage keys and every demo
  role shares one origin, so the gate alone left the roster on screen from
  cache. The demo role picker purges with a keep-list.
- `--c-primary-text` was derived to clear AA on the brand-soft tint only.
  On the plain card surface — links, stat values, the active bottom-bar tab —
  tenant B measured 4.42:1 in dark. `readableBrandText` now takes a list of
  grounds; `design-tokens.test.ts` checks the two surface literals still match
  app.css.

Not done, on purpose: no API, schema or permission changes (the only
server-side file P4 touched is a new test); no D16 commercial controls on
either persona; seven student/guardian screens keep their legacy markup —
accessible, responsive, green in every sweep, and not worth the risk of a
rewrite with no user-visible benefit.

---

## P7 — the Platform Operations Center (2026-09-02)

D16's commercial model, and the enforcement without which it would have been
decoration. Full narrative in [PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md).

### What an operator can do without SQL

Institution state (active · maintenance · limited · suspended) · per-service
enable/disable/maintenance with dependency refusal · role portals open/close
with lock-out refusal · plan assignment · **the plan catalogue itself**
(create, edit, retire) · student caps · manual payments with duplicate
refusal · grace periods · the per-institution audit trail.

Every one states its consequence before it happens, demands a written reason,
confirms, and writes `audit.platform_access` carrying that reason.

### The finding the phase turned on

Three of the console's headline controls were **inert**: `tenants.status`
(R-7), `tenant_operations.portals` and `tenant_operations.services` (052) were
all written, all audited, and read by no application code. An operator could
suspend a school, be told it worked, and the school kept working.

The gate now lives in `withTenant` — the one function every tenant request
already passes through — so **0 of 109 endpoint call sites** had to be edited
and none can forget it. Read-only is `SET LOCAL transaction_read_only = on`,
enforced by PostgreSQL rather than by discipline. `TenantBlocked extends
HttpError`, so all 54 existing catch sites already refuse it in Bangla.

### Enforcement points, for anyone changing this later

| Layer | What it decides |
|---|---|
| `app.tenant_access(t)` | may this school act at all — deleted, archived, legacy-suspended, ops-suspended, maintenance, limited-by-bill |
| `app.tenant_access(t, role)` | …and is this role's portal open (054) |
| `app.tenant_access(t, role, service)` | …and is this service bought and switched on (055). May only ever RESTRICT |
| `TenantContext.service` | which service an endpoint belongs to. Absent = ungated, which is correct for login, branding, people and class structure |
| `SERVICE_OF_ENTITY` (sync-svc) | which service each offline-outbox entity belongs to — attendance, marks, submissions and progress are WRITTEN here, not through the endpoints named after them |

**`services/sync-svc/src/db.ts` is now a re-export of server-core's.** It held
its own copy with an "identical contract" that stopped being identical the
moment the gate existed, and sync is how a phone files a week of attendance.

### Known limits

- **Support mode is deferred** with its blocker named: 18 RLS policies key off
  `app.current_user_id()`/`app.my_section_ids()`, and a platform admin has no
  `users` row inside a school (`B-38`).
- **The audit trail cannot say WHO.** Platform operator ids are JWT subjects
  with no directory behind them (`B-39`).
- **`rms-svc` is ungated** — the routine has no `service_catalogue` entry, so
  it can be neither sold nor disabled (`B-37`, needs a product decision).
- **No online payment gateway**, by D16. Manual recording is the requirement.

## P8 — final legacy cleanup, consistency and release hardening (2026-09-02)

A cleanup phase that found seven live defects, because the way to establish
that code is obsolete is to look at what it actually does. Full narrative in
[PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md).

### The rule this phase leaves behind

**A calendar day is a day in Bangladesh.** The server runs UTC and is six
hours behind Dhaka, so for six hours of every day — midnight to 6am local —
anything reading the host's date names YESTERDAY.

| Where | Use |
|---|---|
| Browser | `todayLocalIso()` — `packages/ui-core/src/format.ts` |
| Server | `dhakaToday()` — `packages/server-core/src/time.ts` |
| SQL, including SQL embedded in TypeScript | `app.today_dhaka()` — migration 059 |

`CURRENT_DATE` and `new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)` are both wrong in
this product, and `apps/pwa/test/calendar-dates.test.ts` fails on either.

### What was removed

491 lines of dead CSS (123 classes) · six dead exports · eleven duplicate
helper copies (four Bangla-digit converters inside `ui/` alone, three
`todayBn`, three `todayIso`) · two indexes duplicating a UNIQUE index · one
orphan design token.

### What was deliberately kept, with reasons

- **`--c-*`** — an alias layer over `--color-*`, 721 live usages, not a second
  system. §3's "confirmed zero-usage" does not reach it.
- **Two table systems and two card systems** — both halves live; converting
  the hand-built call sites is a screen-by-screen change with real regression
  surface (`B-41`).
- **`POST /rms/solve` API-only** — a recorded decision, not an omission.
- **Seven student/guardian views on legacy markup** — `B-19`, unchanged.

### Four new source guards

Each was written because the same defect had already shipped more than once,
and each was proved to fail on a planted defect before being trusted:

| Guard | Catches |
|---|---|
| `apps/pwa/test/calendar-dates.test.ts` | a UTC date used as a calendar day, in JS or in embedded SQL |
| `apps/pwa/test/bangla-numerals.test.ts` | a Latin digit feeding a Bangla counter |
| `apps/pwa/test/icon-names.test.ts` (P7) | a glyph name that does not exist |
| `design-tokens.test.ts`, widened | a token of ANY family used but never defined |

---

## P-pilot-hardening (2026-09-02) — PARTIAL

Two of the six MUST-BEFORE-PILOT items are closed; three are blocked on things
that do not exist yet, and one is written and rehearsed but not run. Full
detail in [PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md).

### Built

| | What |
|---|---|
| **M1** | `loadRoles` requires a live account, so all three auth doors get it; `refresh` keeps its own check for the message; deactivation revokes live sessions in the same transaction and audits the count |
| **M6** | Migration 063 — `teacher_attendance`, `app.teacher_absent_on()`, a RESTRICTIVE write policy; `GET/POST /api/v1/ops/staff-attendance`; the শিক্ষক হাজিরা screen, registered in route, tile, More menu and the sidebar for three roles |
| Pilot fix | A guardian's phone on the admin student drawer is a `tel:` link, gated by the server's existing decision to send or withhold the number |

### Fixed, and not on any list

| | What |
|---|---|
| Migration 064 | `app.set_guardian_permissions` has raised an error on **every call since migration 050** — a partial unique index and a bare `ON CONFLICT` column list. The whole guardian-link path. Production is on 048 and unaffected; the catch-up would have carried it there |
| `rms-svc/api/substitute.ts` | The candidate query passed `slotId` as `$1` and never referenced it, so PostgreSQL refused the statement. **The substitute finder has never returned a candidate.** It had no test at all |
| `scripts/test-all.mjs` | Now runs `db/tests/*.sql`. Twenty-six suites that `npm test` had never run — which is how the two above survived four phases and a full audit |
| `scripts/test-all.mjs` — B-66 guard | Refuses to start on a Node 24 build below **24.21.0**, where a TCP socket inside a `node --test` child intermittently aborts that child (Windows `0xC0000409`) and the suite reports a whole file at line 1:1 with `'test failed'`, no assertion and empty stderr. Measured: v24.15.0 → 11 crashes/500 runs, v24.21.0 → 0/500. `engines` stays `>=22` on purpose — CI runs Node 22 and is clean at 0/500, so a global bump would invalidate green CI for a Windows-only defect it does not have. Off Windows it warns rather than refuses, because it was never measured there |
| `scripts/test-all.mjs` — crashed-child detector | A child that dies before running anything used to be reported in the same words as a failed assertion, which is how B-58/B-66 stayed undiagnosed for three phases. The runner now names the workspace and the file and says the CHILD PROCESS CRASHED — and the diagnosis is conditional on the runtime, so on a patched Node it states plainly that B-66 is **not** the explanation rather than sending the next person after an excluded cause |
| `.github/workflows/database.yml` | The SQL suites and the rollback chain are directory loops now. 13 of 26 suites had never run in CI, and every rollback file from 049 onward had never been executed at all |
| B-43 | Five suites released a fixture lock they never took. Fenced, with a source-level guard |

### Numbers

1,609 tests over 12 workspaces (three identical runs) · 26/26 SQL suites ·
64/64 migrations, 63 rollback files with up → down → up clean for the first
time · typecheck 0 errors, baseline 69 · security probe 29/29 ·
`index.html` `496199bd`, and production serves the same bytes.

### Not built, on the record

The guardian today's-status card, the principal absent-trend, and receipt
serials — all SHOULD-list items. Named so the omission is a decision rather
than something found later.
