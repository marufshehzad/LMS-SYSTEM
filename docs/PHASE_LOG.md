# PHASE LOG — canonical implementation history

**This file is the project's memory.** Decision D10 of
[11-MASTER-PLAN.md](11-MASTER-PLAN.md) makes it the one document a person or an
agent can read, start to finish, and understand everything that has happened
here — without any chat history, without asking anyone.

## How to maintain it

- **Append, never rewrite.** An entry, once written, is history.
- A phase is **not complete until its entry is written.** The entry comes before
  the "done" claim, not after.
- Also log: bug fixes, architecture decisions, migrations, test milestones,
  deployment changes, and important discoveries — not only numbered phases.
- **A decision that reverses an earlier one gets a NEW entry** stating what
  changed, why, and what replaced it. The superseded entry stays exactly as it
  was, with a pointer added to its Status line. Deleting the reasoning behind an
  abandoned approach destroys the thing a future reader needs most.
- Record unresolved problems. An honest known-limitations list is the difference
  between a log and a press release.
- Entries are chronological, newest at the bottom.

## CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

```text
Current Phase:        none in progress — R-7 complete, R-8 not started
Last Completed Phase: R-7 — Tenant onboarding & the platform console (no SQL to add a school)
Last Doc Phase:       R-7-DOC — the specification R-7 was built from. R-7 itself
                      is now IMPLEMENTED; the runbook stays as the manual fallback.
Surfaces:             /  marketing (shikhonBD)  ·  /app  the application
                      /design  the Ata Ekta prototype
Last Commit:          HEAD of main — `git log -1`. Notable earlier commits:

                      NOTE: on Windows the runner silently ran ZERO tests until R-5
                      fixed it — see the R-5 entry, "The tooling was lying".
Build:                npm run build ok · tsc ×3 exit 0 · app.js 95 KB gz / 180 KB budget
Migrations:           45 applied, 45/45 probed by scripts/migration-status.mjs
                      (R-7 added 045: the DEFINER functions that are the ONLY way
                      a tenant comes into existence, plus the student_cap trigger.
                      No new table.)
Known Blockers:       none open. No capability is "Backend complete — UI pending".
                      CLOSED in R-7: onboarding a school without SQL — plus THREE gaps
                      it exposed: nothing had ever written student_profiles (so R-6's
                      search had nothing to find), provision_tenant left no subject
                      template (so a new school could not import ONE student), and
                      student_cap had never been enforced anywhere.
                      CLOSED in R-6: global student search and the multi-year student
                      record — an old permanent ID now returns a graduated child and
                      every year they were enrolled, read from `enrolments` rather
                      than copied into a history table.
                      CLOSED in R-5: branded documents — plus the leak it exposed,
                      where a subject teacher could print a letterheaded admit card
                      or ID card for any child in the school, not just their own
                      sections, because `users_scope` ends with `OR app.is_staff()`.
                      CLOSED in R-4: the academic calendar — plus the write-scope gap
                      it exposed on calendar_days (043), where any student could have
                      declared a holiday and silenced the day's attendance SMS.

Open design question   Money prints in Latin digits (৳ 1,300.00) beside Bangla rolls
(R-5, needs a call):   and marks, because `formatBdt` is shared with SMS and invoices.
                       Consistent product-wide; still a real question. Not answered
                       silently by R-5.

Carried backlog       Recorded, not blocking, from earlier phases:
(R-3, not lost):      · class/section EDIT UI (042 permits the UPDATE; no screen)
                      · guardian unlink workflow (delete is USING(false) by design)
                      · audit viewer: export, and entity-id → name resolution
                      · POST /rms/solve stays API-only by an explicit decision
                      CLOSED in R-2-FINAL:
                        · DB-backed suites never executed — run, and they found 5 real bugs
                        · migration 038 had no probe — probed; 40/40, none unprobed
                        · auto-notice emitters not built — all three built and verified
                        · publish_at was a column nothing polled — now a real status
                          swept by the existing ops cron
                      CLOSED earlier:
                        · two front doors — R-1-A
                        · service-worker deploy staleness — R-1-A
Deferred, not blocking:
                      · SMS send is stubbed until an aggregator contract (R-8)
                      · no real-time push; the bell refreshes on navigation
                      · scripts/test-all.mjs cannot run on Windows (pre-existing)
Next Step:            R-5 — Branded print & document engine (docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md).
                      Not started.

# 2026-08-29 · R-0 · Hygiene

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-08-29 |
| **Phase ID** | R-0 |
| **Phase name** | Hygiene |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete · approved by owner |
| **Migration number** | none |
| **Rollback status** | n/a — no schema change |
| **Git commit** | `a2a26942fe7a503b57344ff67a827ad2a2814189` |

### Objective

Make every later diff readable. Remove the permanent phantom-dirty state in the
working tree and correct stale counts in the status document, so that from R-1
onward a dirty file means something.

### What was already existing

- 38 migrations, ~100 tables, RLS-enforced multi-tenancy, 9 service directories,
  a framework-free PWA — the audited baseline described in
  [11-MASTER-PLAN.md](11-MASTER-PLAN.md) §2.
- `git status` reported 10 modified files under `api/v1/` **on every checkout**,
  while `git diff` showed no content change.
- No `.gitattributes` anywhere in the repository.

### What was implemented

Diagnosis first: the ten files were **byte-identical** to `HEAD` — 0 CR, 2015 LF,
71 505 bytes on both sides. `scripts/build.mjs` writes them with LF (esbuild
always emits LF); with the developer's global `core.autocrlf=true` and no rule
pinning them, Git wanted them to be CRLF in the working tree and flagged the
difference it would itself introduce.

1. **`.gitattributes`** — `* text=auto` baseline; `api/**/*.js` pinned to
   `eol=lf`; `*.sh` and `*.sql` pinned to `eol=lf`; images marked `binary`.
2. `git add --renormalize .` — staged **nothing**, confirming every committed
   text blob was already LF and no history was rewritten.
3. **`tsconfig.json`** — excluded `_design_import`.
4. **`docs/07-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`** — corrected stale counts.

### Important architectural decisions

- **Pin generated bundles to LF rather than change the developer's global Git
  config.** The repository states its own requirements; a machine-level setting
  cannot be relied on across contributors or CI.
- `*.sh` and `*.sql` were pinned for correctness, not tidiness: a CRLF shebang
  makes the kernel look for an interpreter literally named `/usr/bin/env bash\r`,
  and `psql` carries a stray CR into dollar-quoted function bodies. Both files
  run against production.

### Database changes

None.

### API changes

None.

### UI changes

None.

### Files created

- `.gitattributes`
- `docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md` (the audited roadmap this phase opened)

### Files modified

- `tsconfig.json` — added `_design_import` to `exclude`
- `docs/07-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` — migrations 23→38, SQL suites 7→16, test line
  rewritten to what was actually measured

### Files removed

None.

### Tests added

None — this phase changed no product behaviour.

### Tests executed

Full suite as a regression baseline, run directly per workspace (see Known
limitations for why not through the usual runner).

### Test results

**354 unit tests, 0 failures** — offline 46, server-core 75, ui-core 48,
academics-svc 19, rms-svc 15, pwa 143, netlify 8. DB-backed suites in
identity-svc / ops-svc / sync-svc self-skipped (no `DATABASE_URL`).

### Build / typecheck results

- `npm run build` ok.
- The documented three-program gate (`tsc --noEmit` ×3) went from **red to green**
  — see the `_design_import` decision above.
- **The phase's own success criterion:** after a full `npm run build`,
  `git status` reports **0 dirty files**, and CI's `git diff --exit-code -- api/`
  passes.

### Security validation

`node scripts/check-secrets.mjs --history` — 114 commits, no credential material.

### Tenant-isolation validation

Not applicable — no data path was touched.

### Known limitations

- **`scripts/test-all.mjs` cannot run on Windows.** `execFileSync('npm', …)`
  raises ENOENT (needs `npm.cmd`), and the quoted glob `'test/*.test.ts'` is not
  expanded by `cmd.exe`, so workspaces report "0 tests". The first run reported
  all 10 workspaces FAILED — a false alarm. CI on ubuntu is unaffected. **Not
  fixed** (outside R-0's stated scope).
- Running `npm install` per workspace generates `package-lock.json` files that are
  not gitignored — untracked noise. The ones this phase created were removed.

### Unresolved bugs / issues

None introduced.

### Decisions that require owner input

None.

### Next recommended step

R-1 — White-label & branding foundation.

---

# 2026-08-29 · R-1 · White-label & branding foundation

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-08-29 |
| **Phase ID** | R-1 |
| **Phase name** | White-label & branding foundation |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete — with unexecuted DB tests, see Known limitations |
| **Migration number** | **039** — `db/migrations/039_tenant_branding.sql` |
| **Rollback status** | ✅ `db/rollback/039_tenant_branding.down.sql` — drops the function and the CHECK, **deliberately leaves `settings->'branding'` in place** so up → down → up is lossless |
| **Git commit** | `5265ea3e561c4d9b86649d234eca9b3f90363e30` |

### Objective

One deployment, many institutions, each seeing only itself — on screen, in the
browser tab, in the installed app, and on printed paper. The owner's stated
priority #1.

### What was already existing

Tenancy was enforced everywhere it mattered **for data**: `tenant_id` on ~95
tables, a generated RLS policy on every one, `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, a
`tenant_self` policy on `tenants` itself, and a boot guard refusing to start on a
BYPASSRLS role. The `tenants` row already carried `name_bn`, `name_en`,
`address_bn`, `eiin` and an unused `settings jsonb`.

**The visible half was enforced nowhere.** `login-view.ts:98` hard-coded
`'ShikhonBD'`; `manifest.webmanifest` hard-coded one name and theme colour for
every school; `tenants.settings` was read by no code at all.

### What was implemented

- **Branding contract** (`packages/ui-core/src/branding.ts`) — 15 fields, field
  validation, colour normalisation and derivation, WCAG contrast helpers.
- **Print foundation** (`packages/ui-core/src/branded-doc.ts`) — letterhead,
  watermark layer, signature block, standalone A4 document. Foundation only;
  receipts and report cards are R-5.
- **Migration 039** — seeds branding from the tenant's own name columns, adds a
  jsonb-shape CHECK, creates `app.public_branding()`.
- **Three endpoints** — `GET/PUT /ops/branding` (authenticated),
  `GET /ops/brand` and `GET /ops/manifest` (both public, rate-limited).
- **PWA runtime** (`apps/pwa/src/branding.ts`) — applies colour tokens, title,
  favicon, theme colour and manifest link; per-tenant cache, revalidated on read.
- **Branding editor** (`apps/pwa/src/branding-view.ts`) — name, logo, favicon,
  watermark, signature, colours, contact; live preview; save / cancel; on-device
  image downscaling; read-only on 403.
- **Shell + login** — institution plate in the top bar; the school's logo (or the
  first letter of its own name) replaces the platform mark on login.
- **Two demo institutions** in `demo.ts` for side-by-side verification.

### Important architectural decisions

1. **Branding is a column, not a table.** `tenants.settings->'branding'` — exactly
   one row per tenant, always read whole, never joined, never queried by any of
   its fields. It inherits `tenant_self` and `enforce_tenant()` by being part of
   the tenant row. A separate table would have needed its own policy, grants, FK
   and a join on every read, to hold one row.
2. **Assets are inline data URLs** under per-field byte caps (logo 64 KB, favicon
   32 KB, watermark 96 KB, signature 48 KB; 320 KB total). R-1 therefore needed
   no object storage — that decision arrives with R-5's stored PDFs.
3. **One schema, two validators, no drift.** The rules live once in ui-core and
   both the editor and the API import them. The server stays the authority: it
   re-runs `parseBranding()` on every write.
4. **Colours are an allowlist, not a sanitiser** — `primaryColor` lands in a CSS
   custom property, where `red; background:url(//evil/?c=` closes the declaration
   and opens another. Uploaded assets are **raster only**: an SVG is a document
   that can carry `<script>`.
5. **The pre-auth read is bounded in SQL, not in application code.**
   `app.public_branding()` fixes seven returnable keys with an explicit allowlist,
   so a field added to the branding object later is private by default.
6. **An unknown key returns neutral defaults with 200, never 404** — a 404 would
   make the endpoint a tenant-existence oracle for anyone with a wordlist.
7. **Two colour blocks, not one.** `app.css` writes every rule against
   `--c-primary` (not `--color-primary`), and its dark block re-points
   `--c-primary-text/-ink/-link` at lighter steps. Tenant colours are emitted as
   `:root` **and** `:root[data-theme='dark']` at matching specificity.
8. **Tenants are keyed by slug *or* id** — a deviation from the master plan's
   slug-only sketch. The install link the app already uses carries `?tid=`, and a
   v4 uuid is 122 bits of entropy, strictly harder to guess than a memorable slug.

### Database changes

- Migration **039**: `CHECK (settings->'branding' is null or object)`; a seed
  `UPDATE` (re-runnable, never clobbers existing branding); new
  `app.public_branding(text)` — `STABLE`, `SECURITY DEFINER`, pinned
  `search_path`, `GRANT EXECUTE TO shikhon_app`.
- No new tables, no new columns, no data migration.
- Authenticated read/write needed **no new grant**: migration 010 already grants
  `SELECT/UPDATE` on every table in `public`, and `tenant_self` is what confines
  both to the caller's own row.

### API changes

| Route | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/ops/branding` | JWT, any signed-in role | Full branding; every role needs the letterhead for documents |
| `PUT /api/v1/ops/branding` | JWT + `principal` / `school_owner` / `it_admin` / `academic_coordinator` | Merges over saved values, so a partial write cannot blank the rest |
| `GET /api/v1/ops/brand?slug=\|tid=` | **public**, read-bucket rate limit | Seven signboard fields |
| `GET /api/v1/ops/manifest?slug=\|tid=` | **public**, read-bucket rate limit | Per-tenant `application/manifest+json` |

No tenant id is accepted in any URL path or request body for the authenticated
routes — the only tenant a caller can name is the one they authenticated as.

### UI changes

- Login screen: institution name and logo replace the platform mark; tagline made
  generic.
- Shell: institution plate (logo + name) leads the top bar on every screen.
- New route `#/branding` — the editor. Registered for every role and hidden from
  the tab bar; the server decides who may write.
- Dashboard card for `principal` / `school_owner` (replacing the system card) and
  a More-menu entry for everyone.
- Document title, favicon, theme colour and manifest link become tenant-specific.
- `index.html` (the served design mock-up) got an inline branding bootstrap; its
  22 static brand plates were made neutral and are upgraded at runtime.
- Two marketing CTAs linking to `/landing.html` were **removed from inside the
  application** — a platform marketing link in a school's app is precisely the
  leftover platform branding this phase exists to remove. *(The landing page
  itself is untouched — see D11 and the 2026-08-29 rules entry below.)*

### Files removed

None.

### Tests added

**61 new.**

- `packages/ui-core/test/branding.test.ts` — 24. Validation and, more importantly,
  refusals: CSS-injection colour strings, `javascript:` and `data:text/html` asset
  URLs, SVG, oversize assets, control characters, missing names. Plus the
  assertion that `brandingCssVars` never repaints the destructive or status
  colours.
- `packages/ui-core/test/branded-doc.test.ts` — 13. Escaping of tenant text,
  two-tenant document isolation, hostile asset URLs dropped rather than thrown on.
- `apps/pwa/test/branding-ui.test.ts` — 19. Apply, per-tenant cache, cache
  re-validation (localStorage is writable by anything on the origin), login and
  shell for two tenants.
- `services/ops-svc/test/branding.test.ts` — 5 pure (manifest identity) **plus a
  DB-backed suite**: A reads only A, B cannot overwrite A even naming A's id, a
  direct cross-tenant `UPDATE` affects zero rows, teacher read-but-not-write, the
  public endpoint's field bound.
- `db/tests/tenant_branding.sql` — SQL assertion suite, wired into
  `database.yml` (both the first pass and the idempotency re-run).

### Tests executed

Full suite per workspace; browser acceptance test driven manually.

### Test results

**415 unit tests, 0 failures** (354 before → +61):
offline 46 · server-core 75 · ui-core 85 · academics-svc 19 · **ops-svc 5** ·
rms-svc 15 · pwa 162 · netlify 8.

**Acceptance test — passed.** `?demo=1&tenant=a` and `?demo=1&tenant=b` on one
deployment, verified in a browser:

| | Tenant A | Tenant B |
|---|---|---|
| Name | শাহজালাল আদর্শ উচ্চ বিদ্যালয় | নর্থ সিটি মহিলা কলেজ |
| Primary colour | `#156a3f` | `#1b3e7a` |
| Logo | green disc | blue disc |
| Title / theme-color / favicon / manifest URL | A's | B's |
| Letterhead (address, phone, head teacher) | A's | B's |
| Any value of the other in DOM or cache | none | none |

### Build / typecheck results

`tsc --noEmit` ×3 → exit 0 · `npm run build` ok · `app.js` **74 449 bytes gz**
against the 184 320 budget · post-commit rebuild leaves **0 dirty files**.

### Security validation

- `check-secrets.mjs --history` — clean across 114 commits.
- Colour and asset validation are allowlists; every refusal case has a test.
- The public endpoint's exposure is bounded **in SQL**, not by application code
  remembering to strip fields.
- `applyBranding` writes only validated hex into the stylesheet; a test asserts
  every emitted value matches `/^#[0-9a-f]{6}$/`.
- Cached branding is re-validated on read.
- New CI guard prevents platform branding returning to tenant surfaces.

### Tenant-isolation validation

**Designed and asserted; not yet executed against a database.**

The boundary is `tenant_self` (`id = app.current_tenant()`, FORCE'd), not the
handlers. Assertions written in `db/tests/tenant_branding.sql` and
`services/ops-svc/test/branding.test.ts`: A sees exactly one tenant row; A cannot
read or write B by naming B's id; a session with no tenant context sees zero rows;
`app.public_branding()` returns no private field.

Executed locally: **none of the above** — no PostgreSQL was reachable (`psql` not
installed, Docker daemon not running). The pure/browser half ran and passed.

### Known limitations

1. **The DB-backed suites have never been run.** First CI run is their first
   execution. Until it is green, R-1's isolation guarantee is *code-complete and
   CI-pending* — the same status §9a records for Phase 0.
2. **Two front doors** — see entry `R-1-A` below.
3. **`app.js` is cache-first in the service worker and not content-hashed.** A
   deploy does not reach a returning device until `CACHE_SHELL`'s version string
   changes. Pre-existing; it made local verification misleading twice during R-1
   before it was diagnosed. `netlify.toml` sends `max-age=0, must-revalidate` for
   `/app.js`, which helps at the edge but does not override the worker's own
   cache-first decision.
4. **Migration 038 has no probe** in `scripts/migration-status.mjs` — it only
   alters columns, which the existing probe kinds cannot express, so a new
   `column` kind would be needed. 039's probe is present.
5. Colour customisation is bounded to primary + accent by design. Status colours
   and the destructive colour are not tenant-controlled.
6. A branding change does not reach an already-open tab on another device until
   it reloads; there is no push.

### Unresolved bugs / issues

None open. **Two were found by the browser acceptance test and fixed in the same
commit** — both would have shipped had verification stopped at the unit tests:

- The shell's institution plate was captured once at construction and never
  updated when the branding fetch landed, so a device's **first ever launch**
  showed the neutral placeholder. Fixed with `Shell.setInstitution()`.
- Typing in the editor repainted the preview but did not re-evaluate Save/Cancel
  or the contrast warning — a user could rename their school and watch Save stay
  greyed out. Fixed with `syncControls()`.

### Decisions that require owner input

- **R-1-A (below): which file is the real production entry point.** Blocking for
  the pilot.

### Next recommended step

R-2 — Notices & notification system.

# 2026-08-29 · R-1-A · Discovery: two front doors

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-08-29 |
| **Phase ID** | R-1-A |
| **Phase name** | Discovery — `index.html` vs `index.legacy.html` |
| **Status** | 🔴 Open at the time of writing — **superseded 2026-08-29** by the R-1-A completion entry at the end of this log, which implemented Option B. Left exactly as written (D10): this is the record of how the situation arose and what the alternatives were. |
| **Git commit** | investigated during `5265ea3`; recorded in the commit that added this file — `git log --diff-filter=A --format=%H -- docs/PHASE_LOG.md` |

### Objective

Determine which file is the true production application entry point, and record
the finding rather than "fixing" it unasked. Neither file was deleted or moved.

### Why both exist

`git log --follow` settles it. Until commit `c93bddc` (2026-08-23,
*"Add the ShikhonBD marketing landing page and rebuild the app on the Ata Ekta
design system"*), `apps/pwa/public/index.html` was the real 69-line PWA shell,
present since the initial commit.

That commit **overwrote `index.html`** with a 4 341-line design surface built on
the imported Ata Ekta system, and **copied the original shell to
`index.legacy.html`** (Git records it as an addition, not a rename, because
`index.html` continued to exist with entirely different content).

The name is misleading: `index.legacy.html` is not legacy. It is the current,
functional, tested application.

### Which one is currently served

`index.html` — the design surface.

- Vercel: `outputDirectory: apps/pwa/public`, so `/` resolves to `index.html`.
- Netlify: `netlify.toml` redirects `/*` → `/index.html` (status 200), so **every
  deep link** lands there too.
- The service worker's `app-shell` strategy falls back to the cached `'/'`, which
  is also that file.

### Which one is the real PWA

`index.legacy.html`.

| | `index.html` (served at `/`) | `index.legacy.html` |
|---|---|---|
| Lines | 4 341 | 78 |
| Loads `app.js` | **no** | yes |
| Has `<div id="root">` | **no** | yes |
| API calls | **zero** | all of them |
| Auth / session | none | full |
| Data | hard-coded samples | live, via `authedFetch` |
| Covered by the 162 PWA tests | no | yes |
| Linked from anywhere | it is the site root | **nothing links to it** |

### Is the other only a design/mock-up surface?

Yes. `index.html` contains 66 `.screen` divs of static markup with sample
students and sample marks, an inline script that swaps `.active` between them,
and no network code of any kind. It is a clickable design prototype that was
promoted to the site root.

### Consequence, stated plainly

**In production today, the functional application is reachable only by typing
`/index.legacy.html` directly.** `/` serves a prototype with fabricated data;
`/landing.html`'s call-to-action links point to `/`, i.e. to that prototype.

R-1 branded both surfaces, so neither shows the platform brand to a school — but
branding a prototype does not make it the product.

### What the intended final architecture should be

Per D11 and §1a of the master plan:

```text
/                     → marketing site (shikhonBD-branded)      ← today: mock-up
/app  or  subdomain   → tenant application (white-labelled)     ← today: /index.legacy.html
/design or removed    → the Ata Ekta prototype, if kept at all
```

Three options, for the owner to choose between:

| Option | Change | Cost | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | Promote the real PWA back to `/`; move the prototype to `/design.html`; point `landing.html`'s CTAs at the app | smallest — a rename and two hrefs | prototype screens stop being the first thing a visitor sees |
| **B** | Serve `landing.html` at `/` and the app at `/app`; keep the prototype at `/design.html` | medium — routing in both hosts, SW `app-shell` target, `PRECACHE` | matches D11's separation most closely |
| **C** | Rebuild the real PWA's shell to use the Ata Ekta markup, retiring `index.legacy.html` | largest — a UI rewrite | the master plan forbids rewriting the PWA architecture; would be its own phase |

**Recommendation: B**, taken as a small phase before the pilot (R-8) — it is the
only option that ends with the marketing site and the application at distinct,
correct addresses. **A** is a reasonable stopgap if a demo is needed sooner.

### Known limitations

Nothing was changed. The situation persists exactly as described.

### Decisions that require owner input

**Which option (A / B / C), and when.** Blocking for the pilot: a school cannot be
onboarded onto a URL that serves a prototype.

### Next recommended step

Owner picks an option. Until then, R-2 proceeds against `index.legacy.html`,
which is where the tested application lives.

# 2026-08-29 · RULES · Phase log and brand boundary made permanent

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-08-29 |
| **Phase ID** | RULES |
| **Phase name** | Permanent project rules — D10, D11 |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete |
| **Migration number** | none |
| **Rollback status** | n/a |
| **Git commit** | the commit that added this file. A log entry cannot quote its own hash, so it is resolved instead: `git log --diff-filter=A --format=%H -- docs/PHASE_LOG.md` |

### Objective

Turn two owner instructions into permanent, enforced project rules rather than
conventions someone has to remember.

### What was already existing

- `docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md` carried decisions D1–D9.
- R-1 had added a CI guard that removed the platform brand from tenant surfaces —
  correct, but one-directional and undocumented as to *why* `landing.html` was
  exempt.
- No chronological project history existed anywhere. Everything about R-0 and R-1
  lived in chat transcripts and in prose scattered through `docs/07`.

### What was implemented

1. **`docs/PHASE_LOG.md`** — this file. Current-status block, maintenance rules,
   and full entries for R-0, R-1, the R-1-A discovery, and this one.
2. **D10** in the master plan — the phase log is canonical, append-only, and a
   phase is not complete until its entry is written.
3. **D11** in the master plan — `shikhonBD` is the permanent platform and
   marketing brand; white-labelling applies to tenant operational surfaces only.
4. **§1a "Surfaces"** in the master plan — a diagram of which brand belongs where,
   and a pointer to R-1-A as the open question.
5. **The CI guard was rescoped and made bidirectional** (`Brand boundary (D11)`).

### Important architectural decisions

- **The brand guard runs in both directions.** R-1's guard stopped the platform
  brand leaking into tenant screens. The likelier mistake *now* is the opposite:
  "remove ShikhonBD" reads like a rule that applies everywhere, and a future
  white-label sweep could silently un-brand the company's own website with
  nothing to catch it. The guard therefore also **fails the build if
  `landing.html` stops mentioning the platform brand.** Verified by mutation: a
  copy of the file with the brand stripped does trip it.
- **Never state the rule as "ShikhonBD must disappear."** The correct statement,
  recorded in D11: *the platform is branded, the tenant application is
  white-labelled.*

### Database changes

None.

### API changes

None.

### UI changes

None. `landing.html` was deliberately **not** touched — it keeps all 13 platform
brand references, and the new guard now protects them.

### Files created

- `docs/PHASE_LOG.md`

### Files modified

- `docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md` — D10, D11, §1a
- `.github/workflows/frontend.yml` — `Brand boundary (D11)`, bidirectional

### Files removed

None.

### Tests added

No unit tests. The guard is a CI job and was exercised locally in both
directions, including a negative test.

### Tests executed / results

Guard: tenant surfaces clean ✅ · `landing.html` branded ✅ · mutation test (brand
stripped) correctly fails ✅. Full suite re-run to confirm no regression:
**415 passing, 0 failing.**

### Build / typecheck results

`tsc --noEmit` ×3 exit 0 · `npm run build` ok · working tree clean after rebuild.

### Security validation

Not applicable — documentation and a CI check.

### Tenant-isolation validation

Unchanged from R-1; nothing in the data path was touched.

### Known limitations

- The platform-surface allowlist currently names one file (`landing.html`).
  Future platform surfaces — the Super Admin console (R-7), public documentation,
  a pricing page — must be **added to that list when they are created**, or they
  will be branded with nothing enforcing it.
- The guard matches the literal string `ShikhonBD`. A future rename of the
  platform brand has to update it.

### Unresolved bugs / issues

None.

### Decisions that require owner input

Still open from R-1-A: which file becomes the production entry point.

### Next recommended step

**R-2 — Notices & notification system**, per the master plan. Its phase-log entry
must be written before it is marked complete.

# 2026-08-29 · D12 · Tenant resolution & the isolation stack, written down

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-08-29 |
| **Phase ID** | D12 (decision entry — no code phase) |
| **Phase name** | One deployment, many institutions: how a school reaches its door |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete (documentation + decision; mechanism itself was already built) |
| **Migration number** | none |
| **Rollback status** | n/a |
| **Git commit** | the commit that touched only docs in this entry — `git log -1 --format=%H -- docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md docs/PHASE_LOG.md` at this entry's date |

### Objective

The owner asked how one server and one login page can serve Monipur and
Mohammadpur completely separately — different admins, teachers, students,
guardians, data, rules — and observed, correctly, that the master plan never
spelled this out. Answer the question in the plan itself, permanently.

### What was already existing

The entire mechanism. Tenant-scoped user rows, `tid` inside the signed JWT,
`withTenant()` → `SET LOCAL`, fail-closed RLS on ~95 tables, per-tenant
encryption keys, per-tenant caps, the `?tid=` install-link resolution with the
one-time slug fallback, R-1's pre-auth branded login. What did not exist was any
document a reader could point to — the design lived in migration comments,
`docs/01`, and code.

### What was implemented

Documentation only:

- **§1b in 11-MASTER-PLAN.md** — the full write-up: how a school's own link (and
  later its subdomain) routes its people to *its* login; the four isolation
  layers L1 identity → L2 API → L3 session → L4 RLS, with the per-tenant crypto
  key beneath them; how roles stay tenant-scoped; how one person in two schools
  gets two accounts joined by `global_person_id`; and the CI proof.
- **Decision D12** — tenant resolution is per-institution entry links now,
  per-tenant subdomains at R-7, custom domains later; **a school-picker dropdown
  is forbidden at every stage** because it would enumerate the customer list
  (the same reasoning that shaped `app.public_branding()`).
- **R-7 scope** — gains an explicit subdomain-resolution bullet (hostname →
  slug, wildcard DNS/cert, `?tid=` links still honoured).
- The §3 requirement map gains the row the owner's question corresponds to.

### Important architectural decisions

D12 itself (above). One nuance made explicit: the slug fallback field on the
login screen is a fallback, not the main road — the school's handed-out link is
the primary channel because it is the channel schools already use for everything
they tell guardians.

### Database changes / API changes / UI changes

None / none / none.

### Files created

None.

### Files modified

- `docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md` — §1b, D12, R-7 bullet, §3 row
- `docs/PHASE_LOG.md` — this entry; status block now lists notable commit hashes
  explicitly (the RULES hash became knowable after its commit landed)

### Files removed

None.

### Tests added / executed / results

None added — no behaviour changed. Existing suite last verified at 415 passing,
0 failing (see R-1 and RULES entries).

### Build / typecheck results

Docs-only change; `npm run build` re-verified clean at commit time.

### Security validation

No change to any enforcement. The entry *describes* enforcement that exists and
is CI-tested.

### Tenant-isolation validation

Unchanged — §1b now cites where it is proven (CI tenancy suite,
`db/tests/tenant_branding.sql`).

### Known limitations

- Subdomain resolution is a **plan** (R-7), not a built feature. Until then the
  `?tid=` link and the slug fallback are the only doors.
- §1b documents `guardianships`-based guardian scoping and section-based teacher
  scoping as built; both predate this log — their own test coverage lives with
  migrations 002/010, not in an entry here.

### Unresolved bugs / issues

None new. R-1-A (two front doors) remains the open blocker it was.

### Decisions that require owner input

None new from this entry. (R-1-A's option A/B/C choice still pending.)

### Next recommended step

R-2 — Notices & notification system.

# 2026-08-29 · R-1-A · Three surfaces, three addresses (Option B implemented)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-08-29 |
| **Phase ID** | R-1-A |
| **Phase name** | Production surface architecture — Option B |
| **Status** | ✅ **Complete.** Supersedes the 🔴 open R-1-A discovery entry above, which stays as written: it is the record of how the situation arose and what the alternatives were. |
| **Migration number** | none |
| **Rollback status** | n/a — no schema change. Reverting is a `git revert` of the file moves and two routing files. |
| **Git commit** | `git log -1 --format=%H -- apps/pwa/public/app.html` |

### Objective

Give the three surfaces three distinct addresses, so the marketing site, the
tenant application and the design prototype stop competing for `/`. The owner
chose **Option B** from the discovery entry above.

### What was already existing

The situation set out in the R-1-A discovery entry: `/` served a 4,341-line
prototype with zero API calls; the functional, tested PWA sat at
`index.legacy.html` linked from nowhere; `netlify.toml` sent every deep link to
the prototype; the service worker precached `/` as its offline app shell.

### What was implemented

Three `git mv`s (history preserved) and the routing to match:

| Was | Is | Serves |
|---|---|---|
| `landing.html` | `index.html` | `/` — shikhonBD marketing |
| `index.legacy.html` | `app.html` | `/app` — the tenant application |
| `index.html` | `design.html` | `/design` — the Ata Ekta prototype |

- **Marketing links repaired**: 13 CTAs pointed at `/` back when `/` was the
  application, and would have become links to themselves — now `/app`. The 5
  brand-mark links point home.
- **Routing** on both hosts (see below).
- **Service worker** — app-shell scoping, precache target, offline fallback,
  wake-up URL, unhashed-asset policy, cache version. See its own section.
- **PWA manifests** — generated and static both move to `/app`.
- **D11 guard rescoped** to the new filenames: `index.html` is now the
  platform-branded surface; `app.html` and `design.html` are tenant-branded.

### Important architectural decisions

1. **`/` is a real file, not a rewrite.** Making the marketing page literally
   `index.html` means the site root resolves through the static filesystem on
   both hosts, with no config to drift. Only `/app` and `/design` need rewrites.
2. **The service worker keeps scope `/` but narrows what it *treats* as the
   app.** It is registered from `/app.html` and must control `/app.js`, so its
   scope cannot shrink. Instead `isAppPath()` decides: only `/app*` navigations
   get the offline app-shell. Answering `/` with the app's HTML would have
   silently re-created the problem this phase closed.
3. **Unhashed entry assets get stale-while-revalidate, not cache-first.**
   `/app.js`, `/app.css` and `/manifest.webmanifest` matched the IMMUTABLE
   extension test and were pinned to whatever a device downloaded first. SWR
   keeps offline working (cached copy answers instantly) while making the next
   load current. This is §9b known-limitation 3, now fixed.
4. **`CACHE_SHELL` bumped to v2.** `stalecaches()` deletes any `shikhon-*` cache
   outside the keep set, so returning devices drop the v1 cache that held `/` as
   the app shell and a never-revalidated `app.js`. No migration code needed.
5. **The prototype was kept, not deleted** — the owner asked for it to be
   preserved if useful, and deleting a design reference is not reversible by
   reading a diff.

### Database changes

None.

### API changes

`buildManifest()` now emits `start_url: /app?tid=…` and `scope: /app` (was `/`).
No endpoint, auth, or tenant-resolution behaviour changed.

### UI changes

No screen changed. The application's markup, views, styles and behaviour are
byte-identical to R-1 apart from one stale comment reference in the prototype.
Marketing CTAs now open the application instead of reloading the marketing page.

### Files created

```text
apps/pwa/test/surfaces.test.ts
```

### Files modified

```text
apps/pwa/public/index.html         (renamed from landing.html; CTAs -> /app)
apps/pwa/public/app.html           (renamed from index.legacy.html; content unchanged)
apps/pwa/public/design.html        (renamed from index.html; one stale comment fixed)
apps/pwa/public/manifest.webmanifest   start_url + scope -> /app
apps/pwa/src/sw-router.ts          APP_SHELL_URL, isAppPath, SWR for unhashed assets, cache v2
apps/pwa/src/sw.ts                 app-shell fallback + wake-up URL -> /app
services/ops-svc/api/manifest.ts   start_url + scope -> /app
vercel.json                        /app, /app/:path*, /design rewrites
netlify.toml                       same three redirects before the catch-all; cache headers
.github/workflows/frontend.yml     D11 guard rescoped to the new filenames
apps/pwa/test/attendance-view.test.ts   two SW-policy tests updated to the new contract
services/ops-svc/test/branding.test.ts  start_url expectation updated
.claude/static-server.mjs          local preview mirrors production routing (gitignored)
docs/07-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md   §9c, surfaces row, test count
docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md             §1a resolved, test count corrected
README.md                          Surfaces section, D1-D12
docs/PHASE_LOG.md                  this entry
api/v1/ops/[action].js             regenerated bundle
```

### Files removed

None. All three HTML surfaces still exist, under new names.

### Tests added

**17**, in `apps/pwa/test/surfaces.test.ts`:

- The three surfaces identified **by content, not by filename** — a rename that
  swapped two of them would keep the names plausible and break everything, which
  is precisely how this situation arose.
- Both hosts' routing tables, including the ordering assertion that `/app` is
  declared before Netlify's catch-all (first match wins).
- App-shell scoping, including `isAppPath('/application')` being false.
- The unhashed-asset policy and the cache-version bump.
- Manifest `start_url`/`scope`, generated and static, and that the two agree.

### Tests executed

Full suite, plus a browser acceptance test with the origin server stopped.

### Test results

**432 unit tests, 0 failures** (415 → +17):
offline 46 · server-core 75 · ui-core 85 · academics-svc 19 · ops-svc 5 ·
rms-svc 15 · **pwa 179** · netlify 8.

Three pre-existing tests encoded the old `/`-based contract and were updated
with the reason recorded inline — the app-shell navigation test, the
stale-cache-pruning test (v1 is now stale too), and the manifest `start_url`
test. They were genuine regressions caught by the suite, not noise.

### Build / typecheck results

`tsc --noEmit` ×3 → exit 0 · `npm run build` ok · working tree clean after
rebuild.

### Security validation

No change to authentication, authorisation or tenant scoping. The D11 brand
guard passes in both directions against the new filenames. One security-adjacent
improvement: the marketing site is no longer served from the service worker's
app-shell cache, so it cannot be pinned to a stale copy on a device.

### Tenant-isolation validation

Unchanged and re-verified in the browser: `/app?tenant=a` and `/app?tenant=b`
render two different institutions with no value of either appearing in the
other's DOM or cache. Tenant resolution still `?tid=`; no second mechanism, no
school-picker (D12).

### Acceptance test — passed

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `/` | shikhonBD marketing site; platform brand present; does not boot the app; CTAs → `/app` |
| `/app?tenant=a` | Application mounted, SW registered, শাহজালাল আদর্শ উচ্চ বিদ্যালয়, `#156a3f`, manifest `?tid=demo-tenant-a` |
| `/app?tenant=b` | Application mounted, নর্থ সিটি মহিলা কলেজ, `#1b3e7a`; **no trace of tenant A** |
| `/design` | 66-screen prototype; no app boot; no platform brand |
| SW active, fetch `/` | Returns **marketing**, not the app shell |
| Shell cache | `shikhon-shell-v2` only; `/app` cached, `/` **not** cached as a shell |
| **Origin server stopped**, load `/app` | Full application boots from cache with Tenant A's identity, tab bar and offline banner |

### Known limitations

- The prototype at `/design` is static sample data and has no behavioural test
  coverage. It is a design reference; whether it earns its place is a later call.
- Per-tenant **subdomains** remain R-7. Today a school's door is its `?tid=` link.
- The local preview server (`.claude/static-server.mjs`, gitignored) mirrors the
  production routing by hand. If the hosts' routing changes, that file must be
  updated too or local verification will diverge from what ships.
- Carried forward unchanged from R-1: the DB-backed branding suites have still
  never executed, and migration 038 still has no probe.

### Unresolved bugs / issues

None. §9b known-limitation 3 (service-worker deploy staleness) is closed by this
entry.

### Decisions that require owner input

None outstanding.

### Next recommended step

**R-2 — Notices & notification system.**

# 2026-08-29 · R-7-DOC · Tenant onboarding specified, and a manual runbook for the pilot

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-08-29 |
| **Phase ID** | R-7-DOC (documentation/architecture decision — **not** an implementation phase) |
| **Phase name** | Tenant onboarding & provisioning specification + pilot runbook |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete. **R-7 itself remains unimplemented and unscheduled**; R-2 is the current implementation phase. |
| **Migration number** | none |
| **Rollback status** | n/a — documentation only |
| **Git commit** | `git log -1 --format=%H -- docs/PILOT-ONBOARDING-RUNBOOK.md` |

### Objective

The owner asked how a new school or college is entered into the system, and
whether the master plan covered it. It did not, adequately: R-7 existed as five
bullet points naming what would be built, with no answer to *who is allowed to
create a tenant*, *in what order the steps run*, *what happens when a step fails*,
or *how the first pilot schools get in before the wizard exists at all*.

Two gaps, one documentation task: specify R-7 properly, and write down the manual
procedure that has to work until R-7 ships.

### What was already existing

Most of the machinery, none of the procedure:

- `app.provision_tenant()` (migration 012) — seeds academic year, terms, grading
  scale and bands, bell schedules, classes, subjects with NCTB mark
  distributions, fee heads and chart of accounts. Idempotent. Refuses to run
  outside the tenant's own context (`42501`).
- Student CSV import with the dry-run → sha256 digest → commit contract (F-1601),
  creating guardians and `guardianships` from `guardian_phone`.
- Activation codes (F-202, migration 037) — HMAC-stored, single-use, 72-hour.
- R-1's branding editor, and migration 039's seed so an unconfigured school still
  shows its own name.
- `tenants.plan_code`, `student_cap`, `trial_ends_on`, `status` columns — present
  since migration 001, enforced by nothing.
- `audit.platform_access` — present, unused.

What did not exist: a document tying them into an order, and any statement of the
authorization chain for creating a tenant.

### What was implemented

Documentation only. No code, no schema, no configuration changed.

1. **`docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md` §R-7 rewritten** from five bullets into fifteen
   subsections: R-7.1 authorization chain · R-7.2 institution information ·
   R-7.3 id and slug generation · R-7.4 branding · R-7.5 academic setup ·
   R-7.6 teacher import · R-7.7 student import · R-7.8 guardian linking ·
   R-7.9 principal/IT admin creation · R-7.10 plan, cap, trial ·
   R-7.11 suspension · R-7.12 login URL and subdomains · R-7.13 security controls ·
   R-7.14 rollback and failure handling · R-7.15 a nine-screen wizard
   specification, each screen giving fields, validation, dependencies, success
   state and error state.
2. **`docs/PILOT-ONBOARDING-RUNBOOK.md` created** — the manual procedure for the
   first 3–5 institutions, with the real SQL, the real CSV headers, the real
   error messages and what each one means, a verification checklist, and a
   recovery table.
3. **README** document map gains the runbook.

### Important architectural decisions

1. **Tenant creation is never self-service.** There is no public create endpoint
   and R-7 does not add one. A tenant is created by the platform operator after a
   signed agreement, full stop.
2. **Two credentials for tenant creation, not one.** A platform JWT alone is
   insufficient; `PLATFORM_API_KEY` is also required. Creating a tenant is the
   highest-blast-radius operation in the product, and a leaked session token
   should not be enough to perform it.
3. **The authorization chain is written down.** The runtime role cannot create or
   even *enumerate* tenants — `tenant_self` confines it to the one tenant it is
   already inside. Tenant creation therefore needs a `SECURITY DEFINER` function
   with a pinned `search_path`, granted to a platform role only, mirroring
   `app.public_branding()` from migration 039. This also retires the SMS worker's
   `SMS_WORKER_TENANT_IDS` env-var workaround, which exists today *only* because
   nothing could legitimately list tenants.
4. **Audit before the act, in the same transaction.** An action that rolls back
   leaves no misleading audit row; an audit row that exists means the action
   committed.
5. **Suspension is commercial, not destructive.** Login is refused with a specific
   message naming who to contact; data is untouched; SMS and AI stop so a
   suspended tenant cannot accrue cost; reactivation is one status change. A
   suspension that loses data is a suspension nobody dares use.
6. **The slug is effectively permanent once printed**, because it becomes the
   subdomain. Collisions resolve with a district suffix, never a number:
   `monipur-high-2` is not a URL anyone will print on an admission slip. The
   wizard must say this at the point of choosing, not in a help page.
7. **Skipping branding is a first-class outcome.** Migration 039's seed means a
   school that skips it still shows its own name. Blocking activation on a logo
   the office has not found yet is how onboarding stalls for a week.
8. **Only two things block activation**: no academic year, and no grading bands.
   Everything else is a warning. Grading bands are singled out because without
   them `app.compute_subject_grade()` returns NULL and the first result
   publication of the year fails — months after onboarding, with no obvious cause.
   It is the one failure that hides.
9. **Guardians come from the student import, keyed by phone.** Two students
   sharing a phone become one guardian with two children. Getting this wrong
   produces duplicate SMS and a parent who cannot see one of their children.
10. **The runbook exists to inform R-7, not merely to survive until it.** Its
    closing section asks the operator to record which fields the office could not
    supply, which errors were misread, and which steps were done out of order.
    That list is R-7's real requirements document.

### Database changes / API changes / UI changes

None / none / none.

### Files created

```text
docs/PILOT-ONBOARDING-RUNBOOK.md
```

### Files modified

```text
docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md    §R-7 replaced with the full specification (R-7.1 … R-7.15)
README.md                 document map gains the runbook
docs/PHASE_LOG.md         this entry
```

### Files removed

None.

### Tests added / executed / results

None added — nothing executable changed. The suite was re-run to confirm the
documentation commit is inert: **432 passing, 0 failing.**

### Build / typecheck results

`npm run build` ok · `tsc --noEmit` ×3 exit 0 · working tree clean after rebuild.

### Security validation

No enforcement changed. The entry *specifies* controls that do not exist yet
(platform role, `PLATFORM_API_KEY`, `app.create_tenant`) — they are R-7's work and
are recorded here as design, not as fact. The D11 brand guard still passes in both
directions.

### Tenant-isolation validation

Unchanged. §R-7.13 documents the existing controls it will build on; it introduces
no new data path.

### Known limitations

- **This is a specification, not an implementation.** `platform-svc`,
  `app.create_tenant`, the wizard and subdomain provisioning do not exist. Any
  reader must not mistake R-7.1–R-7.15 for a description of running code.
- **Steps 2 and 4 of the runbook need an owner-role connection.** Until
  `platform-svc` exists there is no non-SQL way to create a tenant or the first
  user, which is precisely why R-7 is scheduled.
- **Teacher→section assignment has no UI** (R-3). The runbook works around it with
  a direct `UPDATE sections SET class_teacher_id`, which is enough for a pilot
  school to take attendance but is not the assignment model the product will use.
- The runbook's SQL has **not been executed end to end** against a live database —
  no PostgreSQL was reachable while writing it. It is derived from the migrations
  and handlers, and the first pilot onboarding is its first real test. Expect to
  correct it then, and record what changed.
- Carried forward: DB-backed branding suites still unexecuted; migration 038 still
  has no probe.

### Unresolved bugs / issues

None.

### Decisions that require owner input

None now. Two arrive with R-7: the plan/pricing model behind `plan_code`, and
whether custom domains (`portal.school.edu.bd`) are offered at all.

### Next recommended step

**R-2 — Notices & notification system.** R-7 stays unscheduled; this entry
changed only what is written down about it.

# 2026-08-29 · R-2 · Notices & in-app notification system

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-08-29 |
| **Phase ID** | R-2 |
| **Phase name** | Notices & notification system (owner priority #2) |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete — **finalised by the R-2-FINAL entry at the end of this file** (2026-08-29): the DB-backed suites were executed for the first time, the three auto-notice emitters were built, and `publish_at` became a real scheduled status. The limitations listed below are superseded there; this entry is left exactly as it was written. |
| **Migration number** | **040** — `db/migrations/040_notices.sql` |
| **Rollback status** | ✅ `db/rollback/040_notices.down.sql`. **Unlike 039's, this one destroys data** — notices live only in these tables. Correct for pre-production; once schools are publishing, rolling back means losing the record of what a school told its guardians, and would need an export first. Stated in the file. |
| **Git commit** | `git log -1 --format=%H -- db/migrations/040_notices.sql` |

### Objective

প্রধান শিক্ষক একটা নোটিশ দিলে টার্গেট অনুযায়ী সবার নোটিফিকেশন বেলে পৌঁছাবে — এবং
চাইলে গার্ডিয়ানের ফোনে SMS। The owner's stated priority #2.

### What was already existing

- The SMS pipeline, complete and suppression-aware: `event_outbox` →
  `sms-svc` stage 1 (grace window, weekend, holiday, tenant daily cap,
  guardian consent) → `sms_outbox` with dedupe/segments/cost → stage 2 drain.
  Send stubbed pending an aggregator.
- `guardianships` (M:N, `receives_sms`), `enrolments`, `user_roles` with
  `roles.is_staff` — everything an audience resolver needs.
- **No notices anywhere.** `academics-svc/api/ward.ts` refused to stub §9.1's
  notices card, saying in a comment that the schema has no notices table.

### What was implemented

- **Migration 040** — `notices`, `notice_receipts`, two enums,
  `app.resolve_notice_audience()`, `app.publish_notice()`, RLS for both tables.
- **`packages/ui-core/src/notice.ts`** — the shared contract: categories,
  audience types, validation, Bangla labels, SMS segment maths.
- **`services/ops-svc/api/notices.ts`** — create + publish, role-gated, class
  teachers narrowed to their own sections.
- **`services/ops-svc/api/inbox.ts`** — the bell's data and marking read.
- **`services/sms-svc/src/dispatch.ts`** — a second stage-1 consumer for
  `notice.published.v1`, sharing the existing cap and suppression.
- **PWA** — bell + badge in `shell.ts`, `inbox-view.ts`, `notice-compose-view.ts`,
  routes and dashboard cards for all five roles, service-worker caching.

### Important architectural decisions

1. **Receipts are materialised at publish, not resolved at read.** A notice's
   audience is a question about the past — who was in Class 9 Science F on the
   day it went out. A live query answers it about the present: a student who
   transfers in next week would retroactively acquire last week's notices, and
   one who leaves would lose the record that they were told. Resolving once
   makes the receipt a fact rather than a re-derivation. It also makes the read
   path one indexed lookup and the RLS policy `user_id = current_user` instead
   of a re-implementation of the targeting rules in SQL.
2. **Intent is stored separately from consequence.** `notices.audience` keeps
   what the author wrote; `notice_receipts` keeps what was delivered. Both are
   needed — intent is what an author edits, consequence is what was sent.
3. **The client sends intent, never a recipient list.** A client-supplied
   roster is the confused-deputy shape R-1 removed from branding, and worse
   here: the wrong roster does not show a school the wrong logo, it tells 900
   guardians something meant for the staff.
4. **Category is not audience.** They are separate fields and separate ideas.
   A fee notice addressed to `all` reaches teachers too, and should — a teacher
   with a child at the school is a guardian. If category silently narrowed the
   audience, that parent would never be told their own child's fees were due
   and nothing would report it.
5. **A guardian gets one receipt per child in scope.** Two children, two pieces
   of news. This is what lets the ward view file a notice under the child it
   concerns, and it is why `uq_notice_receipt` uses `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` — the
   default NULL-distinct behaviour would let a re-publish duplicate every staff
   receipt.
6. **SMS reuses the attendance pipeline entirely.** One daily cap, one weekend
   and holiday suppression, one dedupe index, one drain. SMS is ~80% of the
   infrastructure bill (docs/05 §5) and a second path is a second place for it
   to double. The two senders share a mutable budget object so one run cannot
   double-spend the cap.
7. **Emergencies bypass weekend and holiday suppression.** "School is closed
   today" is precisely the message a parent needs on a day the school is closed.
8. **Notice SMS is capped at 180 characters.** A 4000-character notice is 58
   UCS-2 segments per guardian; to 900 guardians that is over ৳20,000 for one
   message. The SMS carries the headline and points at the app, where the whole
   text already is. Not left to whoever writes the notice.
9. **Class teachers are narrowed in the endpoint, not the policy.** Expressing
   "every id in this jsonb is a section you teach" as an RLS predicate would be
   a second implementation of `app.my_section_ids()`, and the two would
   eventually disagree in whichever direction is more permissive.
10. **The composer restates the audience in words above the send button.** Not
    as a form value set six fields ago, but as a sentence read at the moment of
    committing. A section audience says "শিক্ষার্থী ও অভিভাবক" explicitly,
    because "শাখা ৯-ক" reads like students only and it is not.

### Database changes

Migration **040**: two enums (`notice_category`, `notice_status`), two tables
with `enforce_tenant()` triggers and RLS (PERMISSIVE tenant isolation +
RESTRICTIVE read/write scopes), `app.resolve_notice_audience()` (SECURITY
DEFINER, pinned search_path, tenant assertion), `app.publish_notice()`
(SECURITY INVOKER — the caller's RLS decides whether they may publish).

### API changes

| Route | Auth |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/ops/notices` | JWT; RLS decides visibility |
| `POST /api/v1/ops/notices` | JWT + principal / school_owner / academic_coordinator / class_teacher |
| `GET /api/v1/ops/inbox` | JWT, **every role** |
| `POST /api/v1/ops/inbox` | JWT, every role — marks own receipts read |

### UI changes

- Bell with unread badge in every role's top bar (`Shell.setUnread()`); badge
  hides at zero, caps at ৯+, and announces the count to screen readers.
- Inbox: unread carries a left rule and a heavier title, not only a tint —
  a pale background difference is the first thing to vanish in daylight on the
  2 GB reference phone. Opening a notice marks it read; "সব পড়া হয়েছে" exists
  for a backlog.
- Composer: category, audience chips, per-section checkboxes, SMS toggle with a
  live segment count, and the restated audience above Send.
- Notice cards on all five role dashboards; a compose card for principals.

### Files removed

None.

### Tests added

**45.**

- `packages/ui-core/test/notice.test.ts` — 23. Mostly refusals: a broadcast
  audience that also names ids (the composer left checkboxes ticked), targeted
  types with no selection, non-uuid ids, and the assertion that Bangla costs 70
  characters per segment while ASCII gets 160 — and that one Bangla word in an
  English notice doubles the cost.
- `apps/pwa/test/notices-ui.test.ts` — 22. Badge truthfulness and the ৯+ cap,
  opening-is-reading, a guardian seeing which child a notice is about, the body
  inserted as text rather than markup, a class teacher offered sections only,
  and the restated audience following the chips.
- `db/tests/notices.sql` — the audience matrix and isolation: a staff notice
  reaching no student, a section notice reaching that section's guardians and
  nobody else's, a sibling guardian getting one receipt per child, re-publish
  being free, a student unable to read a staff notice by id, and tenant B
  seeing none of tenant A's notices.

### Tests executed

Full suite, plus a browser walkthrough across four roles with the origin server
stopped for the offline check.

### Test results

**477 unit tests, 0 failures** (432 → +45):
offline 46 · server-core 75 · **ui-core 108** · academics-svc 19 · ops-svc 5 ·
rms-svc 15 · **pwa 201** · netlify 8.

Browser walkthrough, one tenant, four roles:

| Role | Inbox | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| class_teacher | 3 notices, badge ৩ | sees "শিক্ষক সভা" |
| student | 2 notices, badge ২ | **does not** see "শিক্ষক সভা" |
| guardian | 3 notices | fee notice labelled "রাফির হাসান" |
| principal | badge ৪, composer | 5 audience chips; teacher sees 1 |

Composer: emergency turns SMS on by default; 150 Bangla characters reported as
"প্রতি জনে ৩টি এসএমএস"; narrowing to staff updated the restated line; publish
reported "৪২ জনের কাছে পৌঁছেছে" and cleared the form.

**Offline:** with the origin server stopped, the guardian's inbox rendered all
three notices from the service-worker cache.

### Build / typecheck results

`tsc --noEmit` ×3 exit 0 · `npm run build` ok · bundle within the 180 KB gz
budget · working tree clean after rebuild.

### Security validation

- The read path interprets no audience: it selects the caller's own receipts,
  confined by `receipt_read_scope`.
- `notice_read_scope` (RESTRICTIVE) is what stops a student reading a
  teachers-only notice — not the category, not the UI.
- `app.resolve_notice_audience()` asserts the session tenant, so definer rights
  cannot cross tenants (asserted in `db/tests/notices.sql` §7).
- Notice bodies are rendered with `textContent`, never `innerHTML`; tested with
  an `<img onerror>` payload.
- Audience ids must be uuids, so a SQL fragment is refused as malformed input
  before it reaches the database.
- **D11 fix:** attendance SMS templates no longer sign "— ShikhonBD"; they now
  carry the institution's own name.

### Tenant-isolation validation

Designed and asserted; **the SQL suite has not been executed** — still no
PostgreSQL reachable on this machine. `db/tests/notices.sql` is wired into
`database.yml` (both the first pass and the idempotency re-run), so the first
CI run is its first execution.

### Known limitations

1. **The DB-backed suites for R-1 and R-2 have still never run.** Two phases now
   depend on CI for their first execution. This is the oldest open item in this
   log and it is growing: R-2's isolation guarantee is code-complete and
   CI-pending, exactly as R-1's was.
2. **Scheduling is a column, not a feature.** `publish_at` exists; nothing polls
   it.
3. **No real-time delivery.** The badge refreshes on boot and after publishing.
   A polling timer on 2G would cost more than the freshness is worth.
4. **Auto-notices are not built** — exam-routine-published, result-published and
   invoice-generated do not yet emit notices. Three small emitters at existing
   publish points; deferred so the surface shipped first.
5. **No editing of a published notice**, and no UI for re-publishing after
   widening an audience (the function supports it).
6. **SMS send is still stubbed** (R-8). Notice SMS queues into `sms_outbox` and
   nothing leaves the building.
7. Migration 038 still has no probe.

### Unresolved bugs / issues

None open. One pre-existing defect was found and fixed: the attendance SMS
templates carried the platform brand into a tenant surface (D11).

### Decisions that require owner input

- **Notice SMS length.** 180 characters is a cost decision, not a technical
  limit. If the school wants full notices by SMS, the bill scales with the body
  and the cap should be raised deliberately, per tenant.

### Next recommended step

**R-3 — Principal & IT admin portals**, per the master plan: the hierarchy
drill-down, teacher assignment and replacement UI, user management, and the
rollover screen. R-2's auto-notice emitters are a natural half-day inside it,
since R-3 touches the publish points they hook into.

# 2026-08-29 · R-2-FINAL · The DB suites were actually run, and four gaps closed

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-08-29 |
| **Phase ID** | R-2-FINAL |
| **Phase name** | R-2 finalisation — real database verification, auto-notices, scheduling, SMS policy |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete. R-2 is now final. |
| **Migration number** | **040 amended** — `db/migrations/040_notices.sql` (never applied to any production database, so amending in place is honest; see "Important architectural decisions" #1) |
| **Rollback status** | ✅ `db/rollback/040_notices.down.sql` — corrected. It previously left `app.emit_auto_notice()` and `app.publish_due_notices()` behind, so `DROP TYPE notice_category` was refused and up → down → up failed. Now verified end to end: descending rollback leaves **zero objects** in `public`. |
| **Git commit** | `git log -1 --format=%H -- docs/PHASE_LOG.md` |

### Objective

R-2 was reported complete with four gaps named in its own entry. Close them
before starting R-3, and above all **stop claiming a database is correct on the
strength of SQL nobody has run.**

### What was already existing

- R-2's full surface: migration 040, the audience resolver, notices/inbox APIs,
  the bell, the composer, the SMS stage-1 consumer.
- 18 SQL assertion suites and a rollback chain, all written, all wired into
  `.github/workflows/database.yml`, **none of which had ever executed** — the
  oldest open item in this log, by then spanning two phases.
- `services/sms-svc` with no test workspace at all.

### What was implemented

**1 · The DB-backed suites were executed.** A `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` container
on port 55432, configured like CI, ran the whole chain: 40 migrations applied
silently, `schema_lint.sql`, `invariants.sql`, `tenant_branding.sql` (10/10),
`notices.sql` (13/13), an idempotency re-run leaving zero rows behind, a
descending rollback, and a clean re-apply.

**2 · Three auto-notice emitters**, all through one `app.emit_auto_notice()`:

| Event | Where | Audience | Idempotency key |
|---|---|---|---|
| Exam routine published | `services/rms-svc/api/examroutine.ts` | students + guardians of the sections with a paper in it | `('exam_routine', examId)` |
| Results published | `services/academics-svc/api/publish.ts` | the same people; **no marks in the body** | `('result', examId)` |
| Invoices generated | `services/finance-svc/api/index.ts` | `guardians_payers` — a new audience type honouring `can_pay_fees` | `('invoice', md5('invoice:' \|\| period))` |

**3 · `publish_at` made real.** `notice_status` gained `'scheduled'`;
`app.publish_due_notices(tenant, limit)` is swept by the **existing**
ops/maintenance cron.

**4 · SMS length made a policy, not a constant.** `NOTICE_SMS_DEFAULT_MAX = 180`,
`NOTICE_SMS_HARD_CEILING = 480`, tenant override at
`tenants.settings->'sms'->>'noticeMaxChars'`, clamped to [70, 480].

### Important architectural decisions

1. **Migration 040 was amended in place rather than superseded by a 041.** It has
   never been applied to any live database — the only copies are in this repo and
   in throwaway CI containers. A 041 that patches a 040 nobody ever ran would be
   a permanent piece of archaeology explaining a mistake with no victims. Once a
   school's data is behind these tables this option disappears, and every later
   change is additive. The distinction worth keeping is between *unreleased* and
   *deployed*, not between *written* and *not written*.

2. **One emitter function, not three.** Three copies of "insert a notice, resolve
   its audience, publish it" would be three places to get the idempotency subtly
   wrong, and the third would be written months after the first by someone who
   had not read the first two.

3. **Idempotency is a database constraint, not application logic.** A partial
   unique index on `(tenant_id, source_kind, source_ref)` plus
   `ON CONFLICT … DO NOTHING`. A teacher correcting a routine and re-publishing
   it must not send 900 guardians a second SMS, and the guarantee should not
   depend on every future caller remembering to check first.

4. **The emitters run inside the transaction of the event they announce.** A
   result publish that rolls back takes its notice with it. The alternative —
   announcing results that were then not published — is the kind of error a
   school cannot retract.

5. **`guardians_payers` is a distinct audience, not a filter on `guardians`.**
   `guardianships.can_pay_fees` already records who is authorised to pay. A fee
   reminder to a guardian with no such authority is noise that costs money to
   send, and in a family where one parent handles school money and the other does
   not, it is also a small breach of an arrangement the family chose.

6. **The result notice carries no marks.** It says results are available. A grade
   is not something to put in a notification that a sibling, a classmate, or
   anyone holding the phone may read over a shoulder — and an SMS is stored in
   plaintext on a device the student often shares.

7. **`scheduled` is a status, not a draft with a date.** A draft is unfinished; a
   scheduled notice is finished and waiting. The sweeper must publish the second
   and never the first, and encoding that in a status makes it impossible to
   confuse — a nullable timestamp on a draft cannot.

8. **The scheduler is the cron we already have.** `publish_due_notices()` is a
   query with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, run by the existing ops/maintenance
   route. No queue, no worker, no new process to monitor. The cost is honest:
   granularity is the cron's, so the composer says *"নির্ধারিত সময়ের পর পরবর্তী
   রক্ষণাবেক্ষণ চক্রে পাঠানো হবে"* rather than implying a precision it does not
   have. A UI that promises 09:00 and delivers at midnight is worse than one that
   promises less.

9. **180 characters is a default, not a limit.** Bangla forces UCS-2, so a segment
   is 70 characters, and SMS is around 80% of the infrastructure bill. But that is
   a *cost* fact, and a cost decision belongs to the school paying it — hence the
   per-tenant override, with a live per-recipient segment count shown in the
   composer before publishing. The 480 hard ceiling stays because past ~7 segments
   the message has stopped being an alert, and the honest fix is a shorter notice
   rather than a bigger bill. The full notice always remains in the app.

### Database changes

- `notice_status` enum: `+ 'scheduled'`.
- `notices`: `+ source_kind`, `+ source_ref`, `CHECK notices_source_is_paired`
  (both or neither), `CHECK notices_scheduled_has_a_time`.
- `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_notice_source ON notices (tenant_id, source_kind, source_ref) WHERE source_kind IS NOT NULL`.
- `notice_receipts.uq_notice_receipt` reordered to lead with `tenant_id`
  (schema-lint L7: a tenant-scoped index must be usable by the tenant predicate).
- `app.resolve_notice_audience()`: `+ guardians_payers` branch.
- `app.emit_auto_notice(...)` and `app.publish_due_notices(...)` added.
- Rollback drops both new functions **before** the types they depend on.

### API changes

- `POST /api/v1/rms/examroutine` (publish) → emits `exam_routine` notice.
- `POST /api/v1/academics/publish` → emits `result` notice; response gains
  `notified`.
- `POST /api/v1/finance/generate` → emits `invoice` notice, skipped entirely when
  the batch produced no invoices.
- `POST /api/v1/ops/notices` accepts `status: 'scheduled'` with `publishAt`.

### UI changes

- Composer: scheduling control with the honest granularity hint; live
  per-recipient SMS segment count; the policy line *"এসএমএসে সংক্ষিপ্ত বার্তা
  যাবে; পুরো নোটিশ অ্যাপে থাকবে"*.

  the settings blob, truncation being visible, and the one that matters: an SMS
  is signed by the school, never by the platform.
- `db/tests/notices.sql` grew to **13 assertions**, including the four new ones:
  auto-notice emission is idempotent; `guardians_payers` respects
  `can_pay_fees`; the sweeper publishes what is due and never a draft; a second
  sweep is a no-op.

### Tests executed

Everything, against a real database — the point of the phase.

```
node --test  (11 workspaces)              661 passing, 0 failing

```

Auto-emitters, verified end to end against the same database:

```
PASS  exam routine  → student + guardian (2 recipients)
PASS  results       → student + guardian, no marks in the body (2)
PASS  invoice       → the authorised guardian only
```

### Test results

**661 passing, 0 failing.** offline 46 · server-core 86 · ui-core 108 ·
academics-svc 78 · identity-svc 10 · ops-svc 26 · rms-svc 62 · **sms-svc 13** ·
sync-svc 23 · pwa 201 · netlify 8.

Running the SQL suites for the first time found **five real defects in committed
code**, which is the entire argument for having done it:

1. `db/tests/tenant_branding.sql` (R-1) used `'college'`, which is not a value
   of `institution_level`. R-1's suite would have failed on its first CI run.
2. Migration 040 joined `user_roles.role_id`. The column is `role_code` — a
   text FK to `roles.code`.
3. Migration 040's resolver used `sections.class_offering_id` and a
   `class_offerings` table. Neither exists; sections hang off `classes` via
   `class_id`. **The audience resolver could not have run at all.**
4. `ON CONFLICT ON CONSTRAINT uq_notice_source` is invalid against a *partial*
   unique index; PostgreSQL needs the column list and the predicate. Every
   auto-notice would have raised instead of silently doing nothing — inside the
   transaction publishing exam results.
5. The rollback left two functions behind, so `DROP TYPE notice_category` was
   refused and up → down → up failed.

Plus four found by the new sms-svc tests and the lint: `Number([]) === 0` and
`Number(true) === 1` are both finite, so junk in a tenant's settings blob would
have clamped every alert to one segment rather than falling back to the default;
and `uq_notice_receipt` did not lead with `tenant_id`.

### Build / typecheck results

`npm run build` ok; `tsc --noEmit` clean in all three configurations;
`app.js` 78 KB gzipped against the 180 KB budget; `git status` clean after a
rebuild, so the committed `api/` bundles match their sources.

### Security validation

- Both new functions are `SECURITY DEFINER` with a pinned `search_path` and an
  explicit assertion that the tenant they were handed is
  `app.current_tenant()` — a definer function without that assertion is a
  cross-tenant read waiting to be called with someone else's UUID.
- `db/tests/notices.sql` asserts the resolver **refuses** a foreign tenant id
  rather than returning an empty set, so a bug can never look like an empty
  audience.
- The result notice contains no marks; the invoice notice contains no amount.

### Tenant-isolation validation

Executed, not asserted on paper: cross-tenant reads return zero rows; the
resolver raises on a foreign tenant; the RLS coverage guard reports 0 tables
without a policy; `schema_lint.sql` reports 0 advisories. Every SMS built by
`noticeSmsBody()` carries the institution's own name — the D11 regression that
R-2 fixed now has a test that fails if it returns.

### Known limitations

1. **SMS send is still stubbed** (R-8, external). Notice SMS queues into
   `sms_outbox`; nothing leaves the building.
2. **No real-time delivery.** The bell refreshes on boot and on navigation.
3. **Scheduling granularity is the maintenance cron's**, not the minute. Stated
   in the UI rather than hidden.
4. **No editing of a published notice**, and no UI for re-publishing after
   widening an audience (the function supports it).
5. The emitters are covered by the SQL suite and a scripted end-to-end check
   against a real database, **not** by an HTTP-level integration test.
6. `scripts/test-all.mjs` still cannot run on Windows (pre-existing:
   `execFileSync('npm')` and an unexpanded quoted glob). Workspaces were run
   individually.

### Unresolved bugs / issues

None open.

### Decisions that require owner input

None outstanding. The notice-SMS cap that R-2 raised is now a per-tenant
setting, so it is an operational choice at onboarding rather than a decision the
codebase has to make on a school's behalf.

### Next recommended step

**R-3 — Principal & IT admin portals.** Not started.

# 2026-08-29 · D13 · A feature is not implemented until a person can use it

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-08-29 |
| **Phase ID** | D13 |
| **Phase name** | UI/UX completeness made a permanent condition of "done" |
| **Status** | ✅ Recorded and applied retroactively to R-1 and R-2 |
| **Migration number** | none — a process decision |
| **Rollback status** | n/a |
| **Git commit** | `git log -1 --format=%H -- docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md` |

### Objective

The owner set a permanent rule: no phase may be called complete on the strength of
its database, service and API alone. Every applicable layer — through the screen a
person actually touches, and the loading, empty, error and success states that make
that screen usable — must be done and verified, or the phase is reported as
**"Backend complete — UI pending."**

Recorded as **D13** in [11-MASTER-PLAN.md](11-MASTER-PLAN.md) §1 with the full
18-layer checklist, the UI-first requirement table, the three acceptance-test
templates (end-to-end, two-tenant, offline cycle) and the phase reporting format in
the new **§1c**. The roadmap's definition of done now names it alongside D10 and
D11.

### Why this rule earned its place

It is not a general principle borrowed from somewhere; it names a failure that had
just happened in this repository. R-2 finalisation made the notice-SMS cap
tenant-configurable, wrote six tests for it, and documented it in three files —
and left no way to set it except writing SQL by hand against production. A setting
only a developer can reach is a setting the school does not have.

That shape recurs whenever a phase is judged by its migration count and its test
count, because those are the parts that are easy to count. A school does not
experience a table or an endpoint. It experiences a screen — and a screen with no
empty state is broken on its first day, which is precisely the day every table is
empty.

### Audit of the completed phases against D13

Applied the rule to R-1 and R-2 rather than only to future work, since a rule that
starts tomorrow exempts exactly the work that motivated it.

**Passing all applicable layers:**

| Feature | Where |
|---|---|
| Branding editor (R-1) | `branding-view.ts` — live preview, per-field errors, contrast warning, save/cancel, two-tenant browser acceptance test |
| Notice inbox + bell (R-2) | `inbox-view.ts`, `shell.ts` — loading, empty, error states; offline-cached; browser-verified with the origin stopped |
| Notice composer (R-2) | `notice-compose-view.ts` — audience picker, scheduling control, live SMS segment count, field errors |

**Backend complete — UI pending (4 found):**

| Capability | Backend | UI | Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Notice SMS cap** `settings->'sms'->>'noticeMaxChars'` | ✅ read, clamped, 6 tests | ❌ no API write path, no screen | Only settable by hand-written SQL. Introduced yesterday by R-2 finalisation — the case that produced this rule |
| **Publish results** `POST /api/v1/academics/publish` | ✅ full result flow, RLS-gated | ❌ no caller in the PWA | `results-view.ts` reads published results; nothing in the app publishes them. **The results auto-notice emitter cannot fire from the UI**, because nothing in the UI reaches the endpoint it hangs off |
| **Generate invoices** `POST /api/v1/finance/generate` | ✅ monthly batch, idempotent per student+period | ❌ no caller in the PWA | Same shape: `fees-view.ts` reads invoices; nothing creates them. The invoice auto-notice has the same problem |
| **Routine solver** `POST /api/v1/rms/solve` | ✅ | ❌ `generation-view.ts` calls `/rms/generation`, a different endpoint | The solver is reachable only over the API |

One further observation, recorded rather than classified: **`GET /api/v1/sync/pull`
has no client caller anywhere.** `packages/offline/src/sync-engine.ts` only pushes.
The delta-pull half of the sync protocol is implemented, tested and documented on
the server, and unused by the app. Whether that is a deferral or an oversight needs
a decision, not an assumption, so it is written down here and left open.

### What this changes about R-2's status

R-2 remains complete **in its own scope** — the notice system it set out to build
is usable end to end by all five roles. But two of its three auto-notice emitters
hang off endpoints the UI cannot reach, so in practice they fire only from an API
client. The R-2-FINAL entry above tested them at the database level and by script,
and both passes were honest about being scripted rather than driven through a
screen. Under D13 that distinction is now load-bearing, so it is stated plainly
here rather than left as an implication.

This does **not** retract the R-2-FINAL entry. It adds the layer that entry did not
examine, which is the point of the rule.

### Files modified

- `docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md` — D13 row, new §1c, definition-of-done bullet
- `docs/PHASE_LOG.md` — this entry, and the status block

### Known limitations

The four gaps above are open. Three of them (publish results, generate invoices,
SMS settings) are principal- and IT-admin-facing, which is exactly R-3's scope, so
they are folded into R-3 rather than logged and forgotten. The routine solver's
screen belongs with the RMS work.

### Next recommended step

**R-3 — Principal & IT admin portals**, now carrying the three admin-facing D13
gaps as part of its scope. Not started.

# 2026-08-29 · R-3 · Principal & IT admin portals

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-08-29 |
| **Phase ID** | R-3 |
| **Phase name** | Principal & IT admin portals (owner priority #3) |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete. The first phase built under D13, and the first whose report separates the layers. |
| **Migration number** | **041** — `db/migrations/041_assignment_history.sql` |
| **Rollback status** | ✅ `db/rollback/041_assignment_history.down.sql`. **Destroys history**: every closed assignment row exists only in these columns, and restoring the old UNIQUE constraint is impossible while they exist, so they are deleted first. Correct pre-production; once a school has replaced a teacher mid-year this needs an export. Verified up → down → up with 0 objects left. |
| **Git commit** | `git log -1 --format=%H -- db/migrations/041_assignment_history.sql` |

### Objective

স্কুল নিজে নিজের সব কাঠামো চালাতে পারে — ডেভেলপার ছাড়া। A principal and an IT
admin must be able to run the institution's academic and system structure from
screens, without SQL: the class → group → section → student drill-down,
teacher assignment and replacement, bulk student moves, the yearly promotion,
user accounts, and the three D13 gaps that had backends and no callers.

### What was already existing

- The whole domain model: `classes` (with `group` as a column), `sections`,
  `enrolments` with per-year rows, `section_subject_teachers`,
  `guardianships`, `year_rollovers` with `app.rollover_preview()` and
  `app.commit_rollover()`, and `audit.activity_log`.
- `POST /api/v1/academics/publish` and `POST /api/v1/finance/generate`,
  complete and unreachable from the app (D13's audit).
- The Ata Ekta component set: `.empty-state`, `.skel`, `.stepper`,
  `.data-table`, `.status-chip[data-state]`, `.inline-notice`. **No new
  visual language was introduced** — every R-3 screen is built from these.

### Three things the schema could not do, and one it lied about

1. **Replacing a teacher destroyed the record of the last one.**
   `section_subject_teachers` was UNIQUE (tenant, section, subject, year) with
   no validity period, so a replacement was an UPDATE and March disappeared.
   The master plan's R-3 required "end old row, insert new — never delete";
   that was a schema capability the schema did not have.
2. **The class teacher had no history at all** — `sections.class_teacher_id` is
   a single nullable column.
3. **`it_admin` was a role no user could hold.** ops-svc/branding.ts has
   admitted it to BRANDING_WRITERS since R-1 and docs/07 documents it, but it
   is not in the `roles` table and `user_roles.role_code` has an FK to
   `roles.code`. `app.has_role('it_admin')` could never be true. The allowlist
   entry had been decorative for two phases — R-3 is the phase that builds the
   IT admin's screens, so the role had to become real first.
4. **The audit log could be written and never read**: 010 grants INSERT and
   revokes UPDATE/DELETE, correctly, but granted no SELECT.

Migration 041 fixes exactly those four and nothing else.

### What was implemented

**Database (041):** validity columns on `section_subject_teachers` with a
PARTIAL unique index over the open rows; `class_teacher_assignments` plus a
trigger that is the only writer of `sections.class_teacher_id`;
`app.assign_class_teacher()` and `app.assign_subject_teacher()`; the
`it_admin` role; RLS + SELECT on `audit.activity_log` for management.

**`packages/server-core/src/audit.ts`** — the first writer `activity_log` has
ever had. Deliberately swallows its own failures: losing a log line is bad, a
logging error that stops a school promoting its students is much worse, and
the domain tables still hold the fact.

**API** — 7 new routes on the two existing dynamic functions (no new Vercel
functions):

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /academics/hierarchy` | the tree, one section, or one student |
| `GET /academics/publish` | publication readiness per exam-subject (new GET on an existing route) |
| `GET/POST /ops/assign` | candidates; assign **or replace** |
| `GET /ops/dashboard` | the principal's morning screen, one round-trip |
| `POST /ops/enrol` | bulk move, preview and commit on one code path |
| `GET/POST /ops/rollover` | preview → plan → commit |
| `GET/PUT /ops/settings` | the notice-SMS cap |
| `GET/POST/PATCH /ops/users` | search, create, deactivate |

**UI** — 7 new screens and a shared `view-states.ts`: principal dashboard,
academic drill-down (with assignment, replacement, bulk move and the student
drawer inside it), result publishing, invoice generation, SMS settings,
rollover, users.

### Important architectural decisions

1. **`group` stays a column, not a level.** The owner's brief draws Class 9 →
   Science → F as three levels; the schema has two, because `classes` is
   UNIQUE (tenant, level_no, stream, group). The API folds class rows by
   `level_no` and presents the groups beneath, so the school sees its own
   three-level tree over a schema that already existed. Adding a real group
   table would have been a second way to say the same thing.

2. **Assignment and replacement are one endpoint.** There is no moment when
   the school knows in advance which it is doing. Two endpoints would mean a
   client that guessed wrong either created a second open assignment or
   refused a legitimate change.

3. **A reason is required to close an assignment, and only to close one.**
   Enforced by a CHECK (`(ended_on IS NULL) = (end_reason IS NULL)`) and by
   the endpoint. A history of changes with no reasons is a list of dates.

4. **The atomic part lives in SQL.** Closing the old row and opening the new
   one cannot be two statements from the API: a failure between them leaves
   either a subject with no teacher of record or two open rows, and the
   partial unique index turns the second into an error at some unrelated later
   moment for somebody else.

5. **Re-assigning the same person is a no-op.** Otherwise a double-submitted
   form writes a zero-length stint into the history a parent will one day read.

6. **Preview and commit are one code path** (`dryRun`), so the preview cannot
   drift from the commit — which is the entire value of a preview.

7. **Capacity is a warning, not a refusal.** Bangladeshi sections run over
   their nominal capacity constantly; a system that blocks the move is one the
   school works around in week two.

8. **The dashboard's attendance denominator is the MARKED students, not the
   enrolled ones.** At 8:40am most sections have not been taken yet, and
   dividing by the whole school shows 4% and starts a panic. `percent: null`
   means "nobody has taken attendance yet" and the screen renders that as a
   sentence, never as 0%.

9. **The fee block is absent from the response, not hidden by CSS.** A
   coordinator's `finance` is `null` server-side. Hiding a card whose numbers
   are still in the body is the frontend-filtering pattern D13 rules out.

10. **No delete anywhere in R-3.** Users deactivate to `status = 'left'`;
    enrolments close; assignments close. `section_subject_teachers.teacher_id`
    is ON DELETE RESTRICT, so the database already held this opinion.

11. **Management reads are network-only in the service worker**, and that is
    the one considered exception in the strategy table. They are read
    IMMEDIATELY BEFORE a mutation, so a stale read means deciding against a
    school that is no longer there. The academic tree stays cached — it is
    navigation, it changes a few times a year, and drilling into it on a dead
    link is the corridor case offline exists for.

12. **Confirmation dialogues state the consequence in numbers.** Five
    irreversible actions (replace, bulk move, promote, publish, generate) each
    name what will happen — including the part that is wrong, like the three
    subjects still unmarked — rather than asking "are you sure?". Focus
    defaults to Cancel.

### Database changes

See 041 above. `schema_lint.sql` passes with **0 advisories**, including the
L7 index-prefix rule on both new indexes.

### API changes

8 routes, listed above. No new Vercel functions: both dispatchers already
exist, so the Hobby 12-function cap is untouched (still 10 of 12).

### UI changes

7 screens, 1 shared states module, dashboards for three more roles
(`it_admin`, `academic_coordinator`, and a rebuilt principal), 7 More-menu
entries, and a service-worker rule.

### Files created

### Files removed

None.

### Tests added

- **`apps/pwa/test/admin-ui.test.ts` — 42 tests.** D13's four states are
  tested as behaviour, and the empty state gets the most attention because it
  is what a school sees on day one when every table is legitimately empty.
- **`db/tests/assignment_history.sql` — 13 assertions**, re-runnable, leaving
  no rows. The one that matters is #3: a replacement keeps the outgoing
  teacher's row, dates and reason.
- **`packages/server-core/test/audit.test.ts` — 6 tests**, the first of which
  asserts that a failing audit write does NOT throw.

### Tests executed

### Test results

Running the endpoints' SQL against the real schema found **one real defect**,
the same way R-2's five were found: `users.full_name_en` is NOT NULL, and
`POST /ops/users` inserted `null` when no English name was given. It
typechecked, and it would have failed on the first teacher a Bangla-medium
school's office added — which is most of them. It now falls back to the Bangla
name rather than demanding a transliteration before the form will submit.

### Build / typecheck results

`npm run build` ok; `tsc --noEmit` clean in all three configurations; app.js
95 KB gzipped against the 180 KB budget (up from 78 KB — seven screens);
`git status` clean after a rebuild.

### Security validation

- Every new endpoint is role-gated with an allowlist that mirrors an RLS
  policy; RLS remains the enforcement and `requireRole` is the clean 403 in
  front of it.
- The two new SQL functions are **SECURITY INVOKER**, deliberately: a definer
  function here would be a way to assign teachers in a school you do not
  belong to. `db/tests/assignment_history.sql` #9 proves tenant B cannot
  assign into tenant A even naming real ids.
- No endpoint accepts a tenant parameter. There is nothing to get wrong.
- Phone search is EXACT; a prefix search over a PII column is a contact-list
  enumerator. The student drawer shows guardian name and relationship and
  **no phone number** — that screen is opened on every teacher's device.
- User creation never touches `password_hash` and returns no credential;
  first login stays on F-202's activation codes.
- Audit reads are management-only (`activity_read_scope`), tenant-scoped, and
  UPDATE/DELETE stay revoked. The suite asserts a subject teacher reads zero
  rows, and that the teardown DELETE is refused to the app role.

### Tenant-isolation validation

Executed, not asserted on paper. `db/tests/assignment_history.sql` covers
cross-tenant reads of sections, teachers, enrolments, assignments and the
audit log — all zero — and a cross-tenant WRITE, which raises. Schema lint 0
advisories; RLS coverage guard 0 gaps.

### Browser acceptance

Run against the real UI at `/app?demo=1`, per Part U, for **principal**, **IT
admin** and **student**. It found four things the tests did not:

1. **ISO dates among Bangla numerals** — the section screen printed
   `2026-01-05` beside `৪০ জন`. On the assignment-history rows the dates are
   the whole point of the record. Added `bnDate()`; now `৫ জানুয়ারি, ২০২৬`.
2. **The demo showed a student the entire institution's structure** — every
   section and every teacher's posting. The server refuses this
   (`requireStaff`); the demo skipped the gate. The demo was lying in the more
   dangerous direction: it is what a person is shown while deciding whether
   the product is safe. All R-3 demo endpoints now reproduce their server
   allowlists.
3. **The invoice screen drew a billing form for someone who could not
   submit it** — the invoice LIST is legitimately readable by a guardian for
   their own child, so the screen loaded. Added `canGenerate`, mirroring
   `BILLING_ROLES`.
4. **A permission error rendered ABOVE an empty state** — "you may not see
   this" followed by "there is nothing here", which are different claims and
   only one was true.

Verified working end to end: Class 9 → বিজ্ঞান → সেকশন F → ৪০ জন with 1 class
teacher, 5 subject teachers and the replacement record; the replacement flow
(confirmation naming both teachers, focus on Cancel, success stating the old
record survives); the SMS cap (৩ → ৬ segments, cost warning at ২.০ গুণ,
out-of-range refused); rollover (blocked students named, commit disabled);
publishing readiness; and the IT admin's dashboard with no finance block and
a read-only rollover.

### Known limitations

1. **The routine-solver discrepancy is documented, not "fixed"** (Part K).
   `POST /rms/solve` and `POST /rms/generation` are **not duplicates**:
   `generation` is the read the UI uses to show a produced routine and its
   trade-offs, and `solve` is the write that produces one. The generation
   screen is reached with `?routineId=`, i.e. it assumes a routine already
   exists. So `solve` remains **backend-only, reachable over the API**, and no
   screen triggers a solve. Nothing was removed or rewritten. It belongs with
   the RMS work, not here — building a second entry point into timetable
   generation from the admin portal is exactly the duplicate system Part K
   warns against.
2. **Section and class creation are not in the UI.** R-3 assigns people to
   existing sections; `app.provision_tenant()` creates the classes and the
   pilot runbook creates sections by hand. A school adding a seventh section
   mid-year still needs the runbook. This is the largest honest gap.
3. **Guardian management is read-only** (Part B). The student drawer shows
   guardians and their fee authority; linking a new guardian or changing
   `can_pay_fees` has no screen.
4. **No audit VIEWER.** 041 makes the log readable and the mutations write to
   it; F-1603's screen is not built. **Backend complete — UI pending.**
5. **The bulk move is capped at 200 students** per request. Beyond that the
   honest tool is the import wizard.
6. **Invoice generation has no dry run**, because the endpoint has none, and a
   client-side estimate would be a second implementation of fee structures and
   waivers that disagreed on exactly the students whose fees are unusual.
7. `scripts/test-all.mjs` still cannot run on Windows (pre-existing).

### Unresolved bugs / issues

None open. Two pre-existing defects were found and fixed: the phantom
`it_admin` role (R-1), and `users.full_name_en` NOT NULL (found by running
R-3's own SQL).

### Decisions that require owner input

- **Section creation** (limitation 2). It is the one remaining routine act a
  school cannot do without the runbook, and it is small — a form over
  `sections` — but it was not in R-3's brief. Worth folding into R-4 or
  taking as a short R-3.1.

### Next recommended step

**R-4 — Calendar & schedule surfacing.** Not started.

# 2026-08-29 · R-3-COMPLETION · The three gaps R-3 named in its own report

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-08-29 |
| **Phase ID** | R-3-COMPLETION |
| **Phase name** | Class/section creation, guardian linking, `can_pay_fees`, audit viewer |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete. R-3 is now fully closed; no capability is "Backend complete — UI pending". |
| **Migration number** | **042** — `db/migrations/042_structure_write_scope.sql` |
| **Rollback status** | ✅ `db/rollback/042_structure_write_scope.down.sql`. Loses SAFETY, not data: dropping these policies returns three tables to tenant-isolated-but-not-role-scoped. Safe only if the matching endpoints go with it, which a code deploy does and a database-only rollback does not. Stated in the file. Verified up → down → up with 0 objects left. |
| **Git commit** | `git log -1 --format=%H -- db/migrations/042_structure_write_scope.sql` |

### Objective

R-3's report named three things it had not delivered. This pass delivers
them, under the same D13 bar: class and section creation, guardian linking
with `can_pay_fees`, and the audit viewer.

### What was already existing

- The whole schema. `classes`, `sections`, `guardianships` and
  `audit.activity_log` all predate R-3; `uq_guardianship_primary` already
  enforced one primary guardian per student.
- 041's `activity_read_scope`, which made the audit log readable and which
  nothing displayed.
- R-2's `guardians_payers` audience, resolving through `can_pay_fees` — the
  column this pass gives a screen.

### The gap the screens exposed

Building them found something R-3 had not looked for.

`classes`, `sections` and `guardianships` carried **only** the PERMISSIVE
`tenant_isolation` policy that migration 010 applies in a loop to every table
with a `tenant_id`, plus the blanket
`GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public`.

That is complete tenant isolation and **no role scope**. Any authenticated
session in a school — a subject teacher's, a student's — could have inserted a
class, renamed a section, or set `can_pay_fees` on somebody else's guardian.

It had been harmless only because nothing in the product wrote to those
tables: sections came from the pilot runbook and `guardianships` from the CSV
importer. The moment there is a screen there is a request, and this codebase's
rule is that RLS is the enforcement and `requireRole` is the clean 403 in
front of it. A screen whose only gate is the endpoint is the frontend-hiding
pattern D13 forbids, one layer down.

Migration 042 adds the RESTRICTIVE write scopes, and `db/tests/guardian_links.sql`
asserts them. The measure of how unexercised that write path was: of twenty
SQL suites, exactly **one** noticed — `ai_human_review.sql` had seeded a class
while `app.role` happened to be `subject_teacher`. The fixture was corrected,
not the policy; a test does not get to set the security model.

### What was implemented

**Database (042):** RESTRICTIVE INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies on `classes`,
`sections` and `guardianships`. SELECT is deliberately untouched —
`guardianships` is read by `app.can_see_student()`, `app.my_ward_ids()` and
the notice resolver on every guardian request, and narrowing it would break
R-2's fan-out and the guardian's own ward view. DELETE is `USING (false)` for
everybody: a class or section carries enrolment history, and a cascade would
take it. Plus `app.set_guardian_permissions()`, which demotes the old primary
and promotes the new one in one transaction.

**API:** `GET/POST /ops/structure` (year, class, section),
`GET/POST/PATCH /ops/guardians`, `GET /ops/audit`.

**UI:** `structure-forms.ts` (three forms, rendered inside the drill-down),
`guardian-panel.ts` (replacing R-3's read-only list), `audit-view.ts`.

### Important architectural decisions

1. **The class form does not offer an academic year, and says why.** The brief
   asked for one; `classes` does not have the column, and that is right — a
   class is a rung on a ladder ("নবম শ্রেণি, বিজ্ঞান") and the YEAR belongs to
   the section. A school does not create Class 9 again every January. Drawing
   a field for a value nothing stores is worse than its absence: it tells the
   office they set something. So the year is on the section form, where the
   column exists, and the class form carries a sentence explaining the split.

2. **No `is_active` on a class either**, for the same reason: the column does
   not exist. A class a school stops using simply stops having sections
   created for the new year.

3. **Search before create, on both sides.** The panel opens on a search box,
   and the server independently links an existing person when a "new"
   guardian's phone is already in the school. The default failure here is
   three rows for one father, one per child: three SMS for every notice on the
   channel that is 80% of the bill, and three logins each seeing one child.

4. **The phone number is withheld server-side, not hidden in the UI.** R-3
   established that a number on a screen every teacher can open is a number on
   every teacher's device, and has a test asserting it. This panel feeds that
   same drawer, so the endpoint returns `phone: null` to anyone outside the
   three roles that may edit it. Returning it and hiding it would leave it in
   the response body, one devtools tab away. The full-text SEARCH is
   restricted outright — it is how you enumerate a contact list.

5. **`can_pay_fees` states its consequence in words**, on the toggle and again
   in the success message ("ফি ও ইনভয়েসের বার্তা পাবেন না"). A permission whose
   effect is invisible is one nobody trusts and everybody works around.
   `db/tests/guardian_links.sql` #6 asserts the wire itself: revoking it drops
   the `guardians_payers` audience from 1 to 0 and restoring it brings it
   back. Without that assertion the screen could be a light switch wired to
   nothing, and nobody would find out until a parent said they were never told.

6. **The last primary guardian cannot be demoted into nobody.** The endpoint
   refuses when no other guardian exists. The primary is who the school rings.

7. **The audit viewer's diff shows only what CHANGED.** Twelve identical
   values with one difference buried among them is how a reader misses the
   difference.

8. **Redaction happens on the way out, not on the way in.** The log keeps what
   happened; the screen shows what a reader may see. A phone is masked to its
   last two digits rather than removed, because "changed to a number ending
   47" is what makes the entry useful.

### Database changes

Policies and one function; no new tables, no new columns. `schema_lint.sql`
passes with 0 advisories.

### API changes

3 new routes on the existing `ops` dispatcher. Still 10 of 12 Vercel
functions.

### UI changes

3 new modules, the guardian block of the student drawer replaced, an
`audit` route, a card and a More entry for the IT admin.

### Files created

- `db/migrations/042_structure_write_scope.sql`, `db/rollback/042_structure_write_scope.down.sql`
- `db/tests/guardian_links.sql`
- `services/ops-svc/api/{structure,guardians,audit}.ts`
- `apps/pwa/src/{structure-forms,guardian-panel,audit-view}.ts`
- `apps/pwa/test/completion-ui.test.ts`

### Files modified

- `packages/server-core/src/audit.ts` (5 new actions)
- `services/ops-svc/api/index.ts`
- `apps/pwa/src/{academic-view,app,demo,sw-router}.ts`
- `apps/pwa/test/admin-ui.test.ts` (the drawer's guardian block moved endpoint)
- `db/tests/ai_human_review.sql` (fixture seeded as principal — see above)
- `scripts/migration-status.mjs`, `.github/workflows/database.yml`
- `docs/{07-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS,11-MASTER-PLAN,PHASE_LOG}.md`
- `api/v1/*.js` (rebuilt)

### Files removed

None.

### Tests added

- **`apps/pwa/test/completion-ui.test.ts` — 29 tests.**
- **`db/tests/guardian_links.sql` — 12 assertions**, re-runnable, leaving no
  rows. Three of them are the write-scope gap: a subject teacher can create
  neither a class nor a section, and cannot change a fee permission — while
  still being able to READ the guardianship, because the notice resolver
  depends on it.

### Tests executed

```
node --test  (11 workspaces)              738 passing, 0 failing
db/tests/guardian_links.sql               12/12 PASS · re-runnable

up → down → up                            clean
scripts/migration-status.mjs              42/42 applied, 0 unprobed

npm run build                             ok
```

### Test results

**738 passing, 0 failing**, up from 709. pwa 243 → **272**.

Running the endpoints' SQL against the real schema found **one real defect**,
as it did in both previous passes: the audit list's actor filter was
`($3 = '' OR a.actor_id = $3::uuid)`, and PostgreSQL evaluates the constant
cast at plan time, so an empty filter threw *invalid input syntax for type
uuid*. The no-filter case is the DEFAULT view of that screen — **every first
load would have been a 500**. It typechecked, and reading it did not reveal
it; running it did. Filters now pass NULL.

The full regression also caught a genuine conflict rather than a broken test:
the new guardian panel showed phone numbers in a drawer any staff member can
open, contradicting R-3's own privacy assertion. Fixed at the server, not in
the UI.

### Security validation

- 042's policies are asserted from a subject teacher's session, not reasoned
  about: three separate attempts, all refused, with the READ still working.
- `app.set_guardian_permissions()` is SECURITY INVOKER; the suite proves
  tenant B cannot write a link into tenant A while naming real ids.
- The audit endpoint is GET-only, over a table where UPDATE and DELETE stay
  revoked; the UI test asserts no control offers to write.
- Redaction is by key name, not by sniffing values — a sniffer misses a phone
  stored as a number and mangles a roll number that looks like one.
- Guardian phone numbers: withheld server-side outside three roles; the
  candidate SEARCH is restricted outright.

### Tenant-isolation validation

Executed. `db/tests/guardian_links.sql` #7 and #8: tenant B reads zero of
tenant A's guardian links, classes, sections (by id) and audit rows, cannot
write a link into A, and A's records are then verified unchanged from A's own
context.

### Browser acceptance

Run at `/app?demo=1` for it_admin, academic_coordinator, class_teacher and
student.

Verified working: creating a class (the Bangla name follows the level chosen,
and stops once typed over) → creating a section → both appearing in the
hierarchy; the guardian panel with its duplicate warning; revoking
`can_pay_fees` and getting *"মোঃ আব্দুল করিম এখন থেকে ফি ও ইনভয়েসের বার্তা
পাবেন না"*; the audit viewer with three data-built filters, a date range, a
diff showing only the changed field, and a masked `•••47`.

Authorization, in the browser: a class teacher gets no create bar, a refused
audit page naming who may read it, guardian names but **no phone and no
toggles**; a coordinator may create structure but the guardian panel is
read-only for them — exactly matching 042.

### Known limitations

1. **Editing an existing class or section is not in the UI.** 042 permits the
   UPDATE and no screen uses it: renaming a section, or changing its capacity
   after creation, still needs SQL. Creation was the gap R-3 named; editing is
   a smaller, adjacent one and is now the largest remaining.
2. **Unlinking a guardian is impossible by design** (`USING (false)`). A
   genuine data-entry error needs a support request. Correcting the
   permissions and the primary flag covers the real cases.
3. **The audit viewer has no export.** A school asked for a change history by
   a board inspector reads it on screen.
4. **The audit entity id is shown raw**, not resolved to a name — "section
   9e52…" rather than "সেকশন F". Resolving would mean a join per entity type.
5. `scripts/test-all.mjs` still cannot run on Windows (pre-existing).

### Unresolved bugs / issues

None open. Two pre-existing defects fixed: the missing write scope on three
tables, and the audit filter's uuid cast.

### Decisions that require owner input

None outstanding.

### Next recommended step

**R-4 — Calendar & schedule surfacing.** Not started.

# 2026-08-29 · R-4 · The academic calendar

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-08-29 |
| **Phase ID** | R-4 |
| **Phase name** | Calendar & schedule surfacing |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete. No applicable D13 cell is incomplete. |
| **Migration number** | **043** — `db/migrations/043_calendar.sql` |
| **Rollback status** | ✅ `db/rollback/043_calendar.down.sql`. Loses `description_bn` and `created_by` on every entry, collapses any day holding two entries of one kind (oldest kept, deterministically), and — the dangerous part — returns `calendar_days` to tenant-isolated-but-not-role-scoped. Safe only if ops-svc/api/calendar.ts is rolled back with it. Stated in the file. Verified up → down → up, 0 objects left. |
| **Git commit** | `git log -1 --format=%H -- db/migrations/043_calendar.sql` |

### Objective

প্রতিটি প্রতিষ্ঠান তার নিজের শিক্ষাপঞ্জি চালাবে — ছুটি, অনুষ্ঠান, পরীক্ষা — এবং সব
ভূমিকা সেটা দেখবে। One deployment, and Monipur's Friday-Saturday weekend
alongside a Madrasah's Friday-only one.

### What was already existing

- **`calendar_days`**, since migration 003: tenant, academic year, day, kind
  (holiday / exam / event / ramadan_schedule / working_weekend), `title_bn`,
  `applies_to_shifts`. **Never had a screen.**
- It was already load-bearing. `services/sms-svc/src/dispatch.ts` reads it
  **twice** to suppress attendance and notice SMS on holidays. A row in this
  table already stops messages reaching nine hundred guardians.
- **`tenants.weekend_days smallint[]`** (0=Sun … 6=Sat, default {5,6}), with a
  comment noting many Madrasah run {5}. The per-tenant weekend the brief asks
  to reuse, and it already existed.
- `exams.starts_on/ends_on` and `exam_subjects.exam_date` — the authoritative
  exam dates.
- R-2's `app.emit_auto_notice()`, idempotent on (tenant, source_kind,
  source_ref).

So: **no new table**, and the feature is mostly a read path over things that
were already true.

### The gap the screen exposed

The same shape R-3 found on `classes` and R-3's completion pass found on
`guardianships`: `calendar_days` carried only the PERMISSIVE
`tenant_isolation` policy that 010 applies in a loop, plus the blanket GRANT.
Complete tenant isolation, **no role scope**.

Here it is worse than it was for classes. **A student could have inserted one
row with kind='holiday' and silently suppressed the whole school's attendance
SMS for that day** — the suppression query does not care who wrote the row.
Nothing had exercised it because nothing in the product wrote to the table.

That is now three phases in a row where adding a screen revealed a table with
no write scope. The pattern is worth naming: migration 010's loop gives every
tenant table isolation, and role scope is added per-table by whoever builds
the feature — so any table the product only ever READ has been sitting
unscoped. R-5 should assume the same is true of whatever it touches first.

### What was implemented

**Migration 043:** `description_bn`, `created_by`, `created_at/updated_at`;
the UNIQUE constraint gains `title_bn` so two events can share a day;
RESTRICTIVE INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE scopes; `notices_source_kind_check` widened
by one value.

**`services/ops-svc/api/calendar.ts`:** GET (range + filter), POST, PATCH,
DELETE. Reads open to every role; writes to the four structural roles.

**`apps/pwa/src/calendar-view.ts`:** month grid, day panel, upcoming list,
kind filter, create/edit form, delete confirmation.

### Important architectural decisions

1. **Exams are read, never copied.** The response merges `calendar_days` with
   `exams` and `exam_subjects` at read time, flagged `editable: false`. A
   calendar row per exam would be a second source of truth that goes stale the
   first time a coordinator moves a paper. `db/tests/calendar.sql` #9 asserts
   that `calendar_days` holds **zero** rows of kind 'exam' while an exam
   exists.

2. **No start/end time columns, deliberately.** The brief asks for them "where
   supported". Every consumer of this table is date-grained: the SMS
   suppression asks "is this day a holiday", attendance asks the same, the
   grid draws a day cell. A `start_time` nothing reads would be a field the
   office fills in and no part of the product honours — worse than its
   absence, because they would plan around it.

3. **No audience column either.** `applies_to_shifts` already exists and is
   the audience this schema has; a morning-shift-only holiday is a real
   Bangladeshi case. Addressing a subset of PEOPLE is what notices are for,
   and R-2 already does it properly.

4. **The academic year is derived from the date, not trusted from the
   client.** A misfiled holiday is a day the school thinks is a holiday and
   the system does not. A date outside every year is refused with "create the
   year first" rather than guessed at.

5. **DELETE is permitted here and forbidden on classes/sections (042).** A
   calendar entry is a PLAN: nothing references it, no history hangs off it,
   and a holiday on the wrong date must be withdrawable without a support
   request. The audit log keeps who removed it.

6. **Notifying goes through `app.emit_auto_notice`** — the same function the
   exam-routine, results and invoice emitters use, idempotent on
   (kind, ref), so a double-submitted form announces nothing twice. Not a
   second pipeline. `notices.source_kind` gained 'calendar' as one deliberate
   value; the allowlist stays an allowlist, and it caught this very insert
   during development when the value was unrecognised.

7. **Deleting a holiday warns that the day's SMS resumes.** The screen names a
   consequence nobody would guess from "delete".

### Offline

**Reads are offline-readable; writes are online-only, deliberately.**

The service worker caches `/api/v1/ops/calendar` stale-while-revalidate,
exactly like the inbox and the routine — a teacher opening the calendar on a
dead link sees the month they last loaded.

Writes are NOT queued through the IndexedDB outbox. That outbox exists for
attendance and marks, which a teacher genuinely takes in a room with no
signal. An IT admin declaring next month's holiday from a corridor with no
bars, to be applied whenever the phone reconnects, is not a workflow — and a
queued holiday is one that silently suppresses SMS on a day nobody has agreed
to yet. Documented rather than claimed either way.

### Real-time

**Not implemented, and there is no infrastructure to reuse.** The brief says
"use the existing event/WebSocket infrastructure where practical"; there is
none — R-2's own entry records that the notice bell refreshes on navigation
for the same reason (a polling timer on 2G costs more than the freshness is
worth). A calendar entry created while a guardian has the app open appears on
their next navigation. Consistent with the rest of the product rather than a
one-screen exception.

### Database changes

Columns, one constraint swap, three policies, one CHECK widened. No new table.
`schema_lint.sql` passes with 0 advisories.

### API changes

One new route on the existing `ops` dispatcher — still 10 of 12 Vercel
functions. DELETE was added to the dispatcher's write-bucket rate limiting.

### UI changes

One new view, one route registered for **every** role, a dashboard card on all
five dashboards, a More entry, a `calendar` glyph added to `icon.ts`, and the
`.cal-*` block in app.css.

### Files created

- `db/migrations/043_calendar.sql`, `db/rollback/043_calendar.down.sql`
- `db/tests/calendar.sql`
- `services/ops-svc/api/calendar.ts`
- `apps/pwa/src/calendar-view.ts`, `apps/pwa/test/calendar-ui.test.ts`

### Files modified

- `scripts/migration-status.mjs`, `.github/workflows/database.yml`
- `docs/{07-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS,11-MASTER-PLAN,PHASE_LOG}.md`
- `api/v1/*.js` (rebuilt)

### Files removed

None.

### Tests added

- **`apps/pwa/test/calendar-ui.test.ts` — 30 tests**, passing on the first
  run. The weekend group is the multi-tenant property: Fri+Sat for one school
  and Friday only for a Madrasah, from the same code.
- **`db/tests/calendar.sql` — 14 assertions**, re-runnable. #1 is the one
  that matters: a student cannot declare a holiday.

### Tests executed

```
node --test  (11 workspaces)              768 passing, 0 failing
db/tests/calendar.sql                     14/14 PASS · re-runnable

```

### Test results

**768 passing, 0 failing**, up from 738. pwa 272 → **302**.

Running the endpoint's SQL against the real schema found **two defects**, as
every pass since R-2 has:

1. `exam_status` has no value 'scheduled' (it is planned / ongoing / marking /
   moderation / published / locked) — in the test fixture.
2. **`notices.source_kind` rejected 'calendar'.** R-2 constrained it to three
   values, so the entire notify feature would have thrown at runtime. The
   constraint doing its job, and the argument for keeping it an allowlist.

The build's own View-tree-shake guard caught a third: the route wiring did not
land (a CRLF mismatch in a scripted edit), so `CalendarView` was absent from
the bundle. That guard exists because exactly this shipped once before — see
the `guardian` route comment in app.ts.

### Security validation

- 043's write scopes are asserted from a student's and a teacher's session,
  not reasoned about: the student's INSERT raises, the teacher's UPDATE and
  DELETE match zero rows, and both can still READ.
- Reads are deliberately open to every role including guardians; there is no
  `requireStaff` on the GET, and that is a decision, not an omission.
- The description is rendered with `textContent`, never `innerHTML`.
- The range is bounded at 400 days so one request cannot scan a decade.

### Tenant isolation

Executed. `db/tests/calendar.sql` #5 and #6: tenant B reads zero of tenant A's
entries, cannot read A's entry **by id**, and its UPDATE and DELETE against
that id both match zero rows — then A's entry is verified unchanged from A's
own context. Two tenants also hold two different weekends (#4).

### Browser acceptance

Run at `/app?demo=1` with two demo tenants.

- **Tenant A (Fri+Sat):** grid shades শুক্র and শনি; holiday ১০ অক্টোবর with a
  rule and an amber dot; **two events on ১৫** both listed; exams merged in
  from the exam tables.
- **Tenant B (Friday only):** shades **শুক্র only**, shows its own ঈদে
  মিলাদুন্নবী, and **none of tenant A's entries**.
- An exam entry has no edit/delete control and says "পরীক্ষার রুটিনে যান".
- Create form: no time field, shift checkboxes (two-shift school), SMS
  disabled until notify is ticked, validation in place, notify confirmation
  focused on Cancel.
- class_teacher, student and guardian: can read, no create button, no edit
  controls.
- Mobile 375×812: no horizontal scroll, 48px tap targets, 31 cells.

Looking at it found one real defect the tests did not: the holiday marker was
an inset box-shadow, which follows the border-radius and rendered as a curved
"U" rather than a rule — decoration where a marker was intended. Now a
square-cornered `border-bottom`.

### Known limitations

1. **No real-time push** — see above; there is no infrastructure to reuse and
   R-2 made the same call.
2. **Calendar writes are online-only**, by the reasoning above.
3. **No recurring events.** ঈদ moves every year and a school enters it once a
   year anyway; a recurrence rule would be a lot of machinery for a table
   whose rows are typically entered in one sitting each January.
4. **`working_weekend` is storable and not yet honoured** by the attendance
   or SMS readers, which only ask about `kind = 'holiday'`. The kind predates
   R-4 and R-4 did not add the reader. It appears in the form because it is a
   real thing a school records; it does not yet change behaviour. **Backend
   partial — reader pending**, and worth an R-5 or R-6 item.
5. **No import of national holidays.** Every school types its own ঈদ dates.
6. **The month view fetches one month at a time**, so a year overview is
   twelve requests. Fine on the SWR cache, wasteful on a first load.

### Carried backlog from R-3 (recorded, not blocking)

- class/section **edit** UI — 042 permits the UPDATE, no screen uses it
- guardian **unlink** workflow — DELETE is `USING (false)` by design
- audit viewer: **export**, and entity-id → name resolution
- `POST /rms/solve` stays API-only by the explicit R-3 decision

### Unresolved bugs / issues

None open.

### Decisions that require owner input

- **`working_weekend`** (limitation 4): should a "working weekend" row make
  attendance and SMS treat that Friday as a school day? It is a small reader
  change and a real Bangladeshi case (make-up days after floods), but it
  changes when SMS goes out, so it is the owner's call.

### Next recommended step

**R-5 — Branded print & document engine.** Not started.

# 2026-08-29 · R-4.1 · Working weekends stop being decoration

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-08-29 |
| **Phase ID** | R-4.1 |
| **Phase name** | Working-weekend integration (R-4 completion pass) |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete. R-4's one open owner decision is resolved. |
| **Migration number** | **none — deliberately.** See below. |
| **Rollback status** | n/a — no schema change. |
| **Git commit** | `git log -1 --format=%H -- services/sms-svc/src/dispatch.ts` |

### Objective

R-4 shipped with one honest gap, recorded as needing an owner decision:
`calendar_days.kind = 'working_weekend'` was **storable and honoured by
nothing**. The owner has decided it should behave as a real override, so this
pass makes it one.

### Why no migration

The `kind` CHECK has admitted `working_weekend` since migration 003; 043 gave
the table its RESTRICTIVE write scope, which covers this kind exactly as it
covers holidays; the read scope is already open to every role; and
`ix_calendar_day (tenant_id, day)` already serves the lookup. There was
nothing left to add. The whole change is one rule and one widened `IN` list —
which is what "reuse the existing source-of-truth tables" should look like
when the schema was right the first time.

### What was found first

The suppression logic existed **twice**, in `services/sms-svc/src/dispatch.ts`:
once in `suppressionReason()` for attendance SMS, once inline in the notice
sender. Both did the same two things in the same order — weekend, then
holiday — as two independent copies.

That is exactly how they would have drifted the moment one of them learned
about working weekends, so the first move was to collapse them into one
exported function before teaching it anything new.

**And a second finding, which is the more useful one: nothing has ever
blocked ATTENDANCE.** There is no calendar check on the attendance path,
online or offline; a teacher could always take a register on any date. So
"attendance remains operational on a working weekend" was already true and
R-4.1 changes nothing about it. What was broken was narrower and worse: the
register taken on that Saturday produced an `attendance.marked.v1` event, and
the sender then threw it away as 'weekend'. The school worked, the children
were marked absent, and no guardian was told.

The suite asserts this rather than assuming it — a teacher takes a register on
the make-up Saturday and the outbox event is verified present.

### The rule

`nonWorkingReasonFor(isoDay, weekendDays, overrides)`, pure and exported so
the decision is testable without a database:

```
holiday                     → closed, whatever else the date says
weekend + working_weekend   → OPEN
weekend                     → closed
otherwise                   → open
```

**Holiday beats working weekend**, deliberately. The schema permits a date to
carry both, because they are different rows; that is a data-entry
contradiction, and the conservative resolution is the right one —
suppressing a message that should have gone is a smaller harm than sending
nine hundred SMS on a day the school is shut, and a declared holiday is the
more specific statement about that date.

### What it does NOT touch

**The timetable.** `rms-svc/solve.ts` derives teaching days from
`tenants.weekend_days` to build a WEEKLY template. A working weekend is one
date, not a change to the week, and a solver that rebuilt the routine because
of a single make-up Saturday would be answering a question nobody asked.

**Attendance.** As above: nothing blocked it, and nothing now does.

### Files changed

- `services/sms-svc/src/dispatch.ts` — two duplicated checks collapsed into
  `nonWorkingReasonFor()` + `calendarOverrides()`; the holiday lookup widened
  its `IN` list, so the new rule costs **no extra round trip**.
- `services/sms-svc/test/notice-sms.test.ts` — +9 tests on the pure rule.
- `apps/pwa/src/calendar-view.ts` — `dayState()` returning one of four
  states; `data-state` on each cell; a legend; the effect written on the
  entry card; a delete warning that is the mirror of a holiday's.
- `apps/pwa/public/app.css` — `.cal-working` (which must actively UNDO the
  weekend shading) and `.cal-legend`.
- `apps/pwa/test/calendar-ui.test.ts` — +10 tests.
- `db/tests/calendar.sql` — +8 assertions (14 → 22).
- `apps/pwa/src/demo.ts` — a make-up Saturday in the fixture.
- `docs/{07,11,PHASE_LOG}`.

### Tests executed

```
node --test  (11 workspaces)   787 passing, 0 failing
db/tests/calendar.sql          22/22 PASS · run twice, 0 rows left
21 SQL suites, twice           all green both passes
schema lint                    0 advisories
migration-status               43/43, unchanged (no migration)
tsc --noEmit ×3                exit 0
npm run build                  ok · app.js 107 KB gz / 180 KB
D11 brand boundary             green both directions
```

**787 passing**, up from 768. sms-svc 13 → 22, pwa 302 → 312.

Writing the SQL assertions surfaced three fixture defects, all of the kind
only running finds: `attendance_mode` is `section_daily`/`period_wise` (not
'daily'), `attendance_sessions.id` has **no default** because a session is
created offline on the device and carries a client-generated uuid through the
outbox, and `taken_at`/`marked_at` are NOT NULL without defaults for the same
reason. A fourth was mine: `String.replace` treats `$$` in the REPLACEMENT as
an escaped `$`, so the scripted splice silently ate every dollar-quote in the
appended SQL.

### Security and tenant isolation

- A student cannot declare a working weekend — asserted, and the stakes are
  the mirror of a holiday's: it would make the school text nine hundred
  guardians on a Saturday nobody worked.
- A teacher reads it and cannot change it — asserted.
- The override applies to **exactly one date**: the adjacent Friday and the
  following Saturday are verified unaffected.
- **Cross-tenant**: tenant B's sender, running the sender's own query for the
  same date, sees nothing — and naming tenant A's `tenant_id` in the
  predicate still returns zero rows, because RLS is the boundary and not the
  WHERE clause. The specific harm avoided: Monipur's make-up Saturday must
  not start the Madrasah next door texting on its quiet day.

### Browser verification

Tenant A, October 2026. The make-up Saturday (১৭) renders **unshaded with a
green top rule and a bold numeral** inside the shaded শনি column, while the
plain Saturday (২৪) stays shaded, unruled and normal weight — three signals,
not colour alone. Measured: `rgb(35,33,32)` vs `rgb(44,42,41)`, 2.67px vs
0.67px top border, weight 700 vs 400.

The accessible name says "সাপ্তাহিক ছুটির দিনে খোলা" and does **not** also
announce the weekly holiday. The legend lists only the states present in the
month. The card explains that the day counts as a normal working day and the
SMS will go out; deleting it warns that the day goes quiet again. A read-only
role sees all of it and can change none of it. Mobile 375×812: no sideways
scroll.

### Known limitations

1. **`ramadan_schedule` remains descriptive.** Like `working_weekend` before
   this pass, it is storable and honoured by nothing — it would need to shift
   period times, which is a routine concern, not a suppression one. Recorded
   so it is not rediscovered as a surprise.
2. **The routine is untouched** on a working weekend: the timetable has no
   Saturday column for a Fri+Sat school, so a make-up day runs on a
   schedule the school arranges outside the app. Making the solver
   date-aware is a much larger change and belongs with RMS.
3. **Holiday-beats-working-weekend is not enforced at write time.** The UI
   does not stop an office adding both to one date; the sender and the
   calendar simply agree on which wins. A CHECK could forbid it, but the
   two are separate rows and a partial exclusion constraint for one
   data-entry mistake is more machinery than the mistake deserves.

### Next recommended step

**R-5 — Branded print & document engine.** Not started.

---

# 2026-08-29 · R-5 · Branded print & the document engine

**Status: complete.** Six documents, one renderer, one endpoint, one screen.
Every document a school hands a family now comes out on that school's
letterhead, and the same code produces a different school's.

## What was asked, and what "one renderer" bought

The brief's first constraint was the load-bearing one: *one reusable
renderer, not a separate PDF implementation per document type*. R-1 had
already built the letterhead (`brandedLetterhead`, `brandedSignature`,
`brandedDocumentCss`) and a single-page `brandedDocument`. R-5 extracted the
page shell into `docSection()` and added `brandedDocumentSet()`, so one page
and forty pages travel the same path; `brandedDocument` is now a one-section
call to the set. R-1's thirteen tests still pass unchanged, which is the
check that the refactor did not quietly become a rewrite.

The six builders in `packages/ui-core/src/documents.ts` are pure functions
returning `{title, meta, bodyHtml}`. They do not know about tenants, HTTP or
the database. That is what makes 45 unit tests able to assert the thing that
actually matters — that two institutions' documents never mix — without a
server.

## Print-first, and no bucket

`GET /api/v1/ops/document` returns **HTML**, not PDF. The master plan says
print-first — `window.print()` plus print CSS — with server-side PDF "only
where a stored artifact is required". Nothing requires one:
`payment_receipts.pdf_object_key` exists and stays NULL because the object
storage behind it is stubbed pending an R2/S3 credential, the same stub as
OTP and MFS.

This is a scope line, not an omission, and it satisfies the brief's "do not
put large PDFs in PostgreSQL" by having no PDF to put anywhere. The browser's
own Save-as-PDF produces the file a school needs from the same markup. When
the credential lands, this endpoint's output is what gets rendered
server-side; the markup does not change.

## The tenant is not a parameter

The brief: *never accept an arbitrary `tenant_id` from the browser as the
authority for document branding.*

Branding is read inside `withTenant()` with

    SELECT COALESCE(settings->'branding','{}'::jsonb) FROM tenants

— no WHERE clause, because a session sees exactly one `tenants` row. There is
no tenantId in the query string, the body or a header, so a Tenant A user
cannot render on Tenant B's letterhead: not because a check rejects it, but
because the request cannot express it. `db/tests/documents.sql` asserts both
halves — the query returns one row and the right one, and naming the other
tenant's id explicitly still returns nothing.

No second branding table was created. `tenants.settings->'branding'` from R-1
remains the single source, per the brief.

## The bug this phase found: printing is not reading

`users_scope` in migration 010 ends with `OR app.is_staff()` — the staff
directory is visible to staff, which is correct for a directory. Every
document builder is fed by `loadStudents`, which selects from `users`. So as
first written, a **subject teacher could print a letterheaded admit card,
report card or ID card for any child in the school**, including that child's
roll, parents' names and blood group — for a section they do not teach. The
marks would have been blank (`exam_results` is section-scoped) but the
document, the identity and the seat would not.

Reading a colleague's name in a list and printing an official document about
a child are different acts. The printed surface is now deliberately tighter
than the directory: `loadStudents` adds `AND app.can_see_student(u.id)`, the
predicate that already existed for exactly this question — `true` for
principal, owner, coordinator, dept head, accountant and IT admin; narrowed
to own wards, own record or own sections for guardians, students and
teachers. An id a caller may look up but not print for simply produces no
page, and a request for nothing but such ids 404s.

The attendance sheet is the one document that is a *section* rather than a
set of students, so it cannot lean on that filter. It asks the same question
directly and returns **403 rather than an empty grid** — a branded but blank
register would have looked like a working feature.

Tests 5 and 6 of `db/tests/documents.sql` are a pair on purpose: test 5
proves the directory hole is real, so that the guard in test 6 is not deleted
later as belt-and-braces.

## The other defects, all found by running or looking

1. **The receipt printed `2026-05` as the billing month**, and dated itself
   with `formatShortDate` — which is documented as the *SMS* short form,
   where every character costs money, and drops the year. §18 of the brief
   forbids raw ISO dates in official documents. Fixed with local `date()`
   and `monthLabel()` helpers, giving `১২ মে ২০২৬` and `মে ২০২৬`. Caught by a
   test that sweeps whole documents for date-shaped text.
2. **`exam_halls` has no `name_bn`.** It points at a `rooms` row, which is
   where the code a candidate reads on the door lives. Found by running the
   admit-card query against the real schema rather than reading it.
3. **Three of my own tests were over-broad**, matching class names inside the
   inlined stylesheet rather than elements — `doc-sign-img` appears as a CSS
   rule whether or not an `<img>` does. They now assert on elements. A test
   that fails on correct output is worse than no test.
4. **The ID-card doc comment claimed the card skips the A4 letterhead.** The
   render showed it plainly does not. The comment was wrong, not the code;
   see Known limitations.

## The tooling was lying, and had been for some time

Running the quality gate on Windows produced eleven identical `FAIL` lines
with no output. Two faults, one hiding the other:

1. `execFileSync('npm', …)` cannot spawn `npm.cmd` (ENOENT, then EINVAL once
   given the extension — Node ≥20 refuses `.cmd` without a shell). Now
   `execSync('npm test --silent')`.
2. Worse and quieter: every workspace's script was
   `node --test 'test/*.test.ts'`. A POSIX shell strips those quotes; **cmd
   passes them through literally, nothing matches, and node exits 0 having
   run zero tests.** On Windows the whole suite reported success while
   running nothing — precisely the invisible-tests failure `test-all.mjs`
   exists to prevent, in that script's own tooling. All eleven are now
   double-quoted, which both shells strip and node globs for itself.

The runner now prints `0 tests — NOTHING RAN` instead of a tick, because
"ok 0 tests" and "ok 153 tests" looked identical. It is not a hard error:
zero is legitimate for the DB-backed suites when `DATABASE_URL` is unset.
Linux CI never saw either fault.

## Authorization

`ACCESS` in `services/ops-svc/api/document.ts` is a per-type allowlist —
money documents follow finance-svc's `BILLING_ROLES`, result documents follow
the publish gate plus class teachers, and the **transfer certificate is
principal-only**, deliberately narrower than the rest, because it is a legal
statement about a child's record. The list decides who may *ask* for a type;
RLS plus `can_see_student` decides *which children* they get.

`apps/pwa/src/app.ts` mirrors the list in `DOCS_FOR`, so the picker offers a
student exactly three documents and a principal six. The demo layer
reproduces the 403 rather than skipping it — a demo that let a guardian print
a transfer certificate would teach the wrong thing about the product.

No arbitrary document URLs exist: the response is `no-store, private`,
`nosniff`, `SAMEORIGIN`, and the preview is an **iframe `srcdoc`, not a
`src`**. A URL would have needed a cookie or a token in the query string,
which §15 forbids; `srcdoc` means the bytes arrive with the caller's bearer
token and never become an address. The iframe's sandbox is
`allow-same-origin allow-modals` — `allow-scripts` is deliberately absent, so
a hostile string that survived escaping still cannot run.

No CSS or HTML injection is offered to tenant admins. Branding is a fixed set
of typed fields from R-1; every interpolation goes through `escapeHtml`,
including the ones that obviously cannot contain markup, because that
judgement is what rots. Two tests attack it — a hostile institution name and
a hostile student name.

## Tests

- **45 new unit tests** (`packages/ui-core/test/documents.test.ts`), two
  fixture tenants plus a bare one: neither leaks into the other, no ISO date
  or raw billing period reaches a document, a missing logo, watermark or
  signature degrades rather than breaking, markup injection is escaped, and
  forty report cards are forty fully-branded pages.
- **12 new SQL assertions** (`db/tests/documents.sql`), wired into
  `.github/workflows/database.yml` including the idempotency re-run. It
  pre-cleans as well as tears down, so a failed run reports the real failure
  instead of a duplicate key. Verified re-runnable, twice, leaving nothing.
- Full gate: **832 tests across 11 workspaces, all passing**, against a real
  PostgreSQL 16. All nine SQL suites green. `tsc` clean, `npm run build` ok,
  D11 guard green in both directions.

`packages/ui-core/src` was added to the D11 tenant-facing list: it is where
every document template now lives, and a printed transfer certificate is the
most tenant-facing surface the product has.

## Browser verification — two tenants, four documents each

Rendered through the real builders and the real `brandedDocumentSet`, and
looked at.

- **Report card, side by side.** Same student, same marks, same code.
  Shahjalal: green `#156a3f`, Sylhet address, মোঃ আব্দুল কাদের. North City:
  navy `#1b3e7a`, Uttara address, অধ্যাপক সালমা বেগম. Zero trace of either
  in the other; no `shikhon` anywhere in the markup.
- **Bulk**: a 38-student section produced 38 `<main class="doc">`, 38
  letterheads and 38 signature blocks in **one** request and one document.
- **Degradation**: both demo tenants have no watermark and no signature
  image. No `<img src="">` was emitted; the signature became a gap plus a
  rule, so the head signs by hand. The ID-card photo is a labelled frame
  reading ছবি, not a broken-image box.
- **Localisation**: marks, rolls, percentages and dates in Bangla digits;
  the absent subject reads অনুপস্থিত, not a zero. Latin digits appear only
  in phone numbers, email addresses and the student code — all of which are
  Latin on purpose.
- **The transfer certificate** reads as a formal Bangla certificate
  (এই মর্মে প্রত্যয়ন করা যাইতেছে যে…) with every date spelled out.
- **Print**: `@page {size:A4}`, `.doc+.doc{page-break-before:always}`,
  `thead{display:table-header-group}` so a long table repeats its header,
  `page-break-inside:avoid` on rows and the signature block, and
  `@media print { body > .shell { display:none } }` so the app chrome does
  not print. All five verified in the live document, not in the source file.
- **Role gate**: as `student`, the picker offers ফি রসিদ, প্রগতি পত্র and
  প্রবেশপত্র — and nothing else. As `principal`, all six.

## Known limitations

1. **One ID card per A4 sheet.** A section of 38 is 38 sheets to cut up.
   Laying several to a page needs a second page geometry the renderer does
   not have, and inventing one would mean a second print path to keep
   correct. A decision, not an oversight — and the doc comment that wrongly
   claimed ID cards skip the letterhead has been corrected to say so.
2. **Money is printed in Latin digits** (`৳ 1,300.00`) while rolls and marks
   are Bangla, because `formatBdt` is the product-wide money formatter shared
   with SMS and invoices. Making documents differ would mean a receipt and
   the SMS about the same payment disagreeing on how to write the amount.
   Consistent, but it is a real design question and R-5 should not answer it
   silently — flagged for a decision.
3. **No server-side PDF and no stored artifact**, per the section above.
   Nothing in the product needs one yet.
4. **`DOC_ACCESS` in `apps/pwa/src/demo.ts` duplicates the server's
   `ACCESS`** rather than importing it, because the server's copy must not
   reach the browser bundle. If they drift, the browser acceptance is what
   catches it.

## Carried backlog (unchanged, from R-3)

class/section edit UI · guardian unlink workflow · audit export and
entity-name resolution · `POST /rms/solve` API-only by decision.

## Unresolved bugs / issues

One disclosure, not a code issue: the design hook flags
`packages/ui-core/test/documents.test.ts` line 175 as `broken-image`. It is a
false positive — the line is `assert.doesNotMatch(html, /<img[^>]*src=""/)`,
an assertion that the product **never** emits a broken image. An attempt to
persist the narrowest ignore was blocked, so the finding is left standing
rather than suppressed quietly.

## Next recommended step

**R-6.** Not started. R-5 stopped here as instructed.

---

# 2026-08-29 · R-6 · Student history & global search

**Status: complete.** A principal types `STU-8F39A271` and gets রাফি হাসান,
উত্তীর্ণ, with four years of enrolment — each year holding the class, section
and roll he actually had that year.

## The history already existed; it had never been readable

`enrolments` has carried one row per student per academic year since
migration 003 — section, roll, status, the dates it opened and closed. That
IS the multi-year history the master plan asks for, and R-6 reads it rather
than denormalising a copy. §4 of the brief said not to build a history table
unless truly necessary; it was not necessary, and a second copy of the truth
would be a second thing to get wrong during a rollover, which already writes
these rows.

So R-6 added **no table, no column and no policy**. One migration, and it
contains one index.

## Migration 044 — one index, and the measurement that earned it

`enrolments` had three indexes and all three answer "who is in this
section/year". None answered "where has this child been": `student_id` is the
LAST column of the only index that mentions it, so a per-student lookup walks
every entry for the tenant and filters.

Measured against a seeded school of 2,000 students × 4 years = 8,000 enrolment
rows (PostgreSQL 16, EXPLAIN ANALYZE, warm):

| plan | time |
|---|---|
| seq scan (what the planner chose) | 1.255 ms, 7,997 rows discarded |
| forced index scan on the (tenant, year, student) unique index — a walk, not a seek | 0.712 ms |
| `ix_enrolment_student_history` (tenant, student, year) | **0.089 ms**, 4 rows read |

Fourteen times faster matters less than the shape: the scan is linear in the
whole school's history, so a ten-year-old school pays 200,000 rows for one
child's four, while the seek stays flat. The years are exactly what makes the
old plan worse, and the years are the feature.

The index carries `academic_year_id` third so it also supplies the timeline's
ordering. `IF NOT EXISTS`, and the rollback drops it and loses nothing —
verified down → up on a live database.

## Search is indexed because the query is classified first

The obvious endpoint is one `WHERE` with six `OR`s across code, two name
columns, phone and two board numbers. It reads well and cannot use an index.

So `classify()` decides what was typed and each shape gets the predicate its
own index answers — `STU-…` → the unique code index, `01712…` → the phone
index, Bangla or English text → the trigram indexes, `BR-…` → a scan, and
said so. **No Elasticsearch**: §15 asked not to add one unless PostgreSQL
could not do the job, and PostgreSQL does every shape in under 12 ms
end-to-end.

Two findings from measuring rather than assuming:

1. **`uq_users_tenant_phone` is a PARTIAL index** — `WHERE phone_e164 IS NOT
   NULL AND deleted_at IS NULL` — and PostgreSQL will not use a partial index
   unless the query implies its predicate. Without `deleted_at IS NULL` the
   phone lookup seq-scans: 0.292 ms against 0.026 ms. It is in the WHERE for
   that reason as well as the obvious one.
2. **`app.can_see_student` costs a call per row**, because it takes a row
   argument. On a name search matching 166 students that dominated the query
   at 10.7 ms. `app.has_role(...)` takes no row argument, so it evaluates once
   and short-circuits the OR for management: **2.8 ms, identical 166 rows**.
   Every role in the short-circuit list is one whose `can_see_student` falls
   through to `ELSE true`, so this is a cheaper way to ask the same question
   rather than a looser one — and `users_scope` in migration 010 is written
   the same way for the same reason.

## Authorization reuses `app.can_see_student`, and supersedes one plan line

§13 said not to create a new authorization model, and none was created. Every
row both endpoints return passes the predicate the RLS policies already use,
so the role rules fall out instead of being enforced:

- principal / owner / coordinator / dept head / accountant / IT admin → the
  whole school, alumni included
- class teacher / subject teacher → the children in their own sections
- guardian → their own wards · student → themselves

**This supersedes, and does not erase, the master plan's R-6 line** that said
"staff-gated" and "RLS keeps student/guardian out of the search endpoint".
R-6's brief asks in §13 and §18 for guardian and student access, scoped.
Routing them through `can_see_student` satisfies both readings at once: they
may call it, and it can only ever return themselves or their children — which
the tests assert directly.

A teacher does **not** get global search, per §13.

## Privacy: tighter than RLS in one place, again

The R-5 pattern repeats. `invoice_scope` (migration 010) reads
`has_role(principal, owner, accountant) OR can_see_student(student_id)`, so
RLS alone shows a **class teacher the fee balance of every child in their
section**. A class teacher has no reason to know which families are behind on
fees. `MAY_SEE_FEES` in the endpoint is narrower, and the fees tab is not
rendered disabled for them — it is not rendered at all, because a greyed-out
tab announces that a balance exists and they are not trusted with it.

`db/tests/student_search.sql` test 9 records BOTH facts, so if someone later
tightens the policy the test says the application gate became redundant
rather than wrong.

Contact details follow R-3's line: withheld at the SERVER, never sent, and
the screen says `যোগাযোগ ও ব্যক্তিগত তথ্য দেখার অনুমতি আপনার নেই।` rather than
silently omitting fields. Verified in the browser as a subject teacher: no
phone, no parents' names, no blood group, no board registration in the
payload at all.

The result list carries only what tells two children with the same name
apart — code, class, group, section, roll, status. Asserted by sweeping the
serialised response for a phone number, a blood group and a parent's name.

## The defects this phase found

1. **A Latin digit inside a Bangla sentence.** The too-short message
   interpolated `MIN_QUERY` and produced `অনুসন্ধানের জন্য অন্তত 2টি অক্ষর
   লিখুন।` §17 specifies `২`. Caught by a test asserting the brief's own
   wording — the same class of almost-Bangla R-5 refused in documents.
2. **`Promise.all` over one pg client.** The history endpoint ran its four
   loads "in parallel" on a single client inside a transaction. node-pg
   serialises them anyway and warns; pg 9 removes the behaviour. The
   parallelism was imaginary — the timings are unchanged after making it
   sequential. Found by reading a deprecation warning during the performance
   run, not by a failing test.
3. **A demo fixture that matched the whole school on any Bangla query.**
   `'সুমাইয়া'.replace(/[^\d]/g,'')` is `''`, and `String.includes('')` is
   true for every string, so the phone branch matched everyone. Worth
   recording because the real endpoint **cannot** have this bug: it
   classifies the query and runs exactly one branch, which is the reason it
   does that. The demo had OR'd everything — the naive design, demonstrating
   its own failure mode.
4. **A note flush against the screen edge.** `.page-sub` gets its horizontal
   padding from `.page-header`; used standalone it hugged the edge while the
   list beside it was indented. Visible at 375px, invisible on a wide screen.

## The brief's status list is not the column's

§1 listed *Active, Transferred, Withdrawn, Graduated, Archived, Alumni*. The
`lifecycle_status` CHECK permits *enrolled, promoted, transferred_out,
dropped_out, graduated, alumni*. The brief also says to reuse the existing
model, so the filter offers the column's six, in Bangla:

`অধ্যয়নরত · উন্নীত · ছাড়পত্র নিয়েছে · ঝরে পড়েছে · উত্তীর্ণ · প্রাক্তন শিক্ষার্থী`

"Withdrawn" maps to `dropped_out`; **"Archived" has no equivalent and was not
invented**; `promoted` has no name in the brief's list at all. A DB test
asserts that every status the endpoint offers is one the column permits, so
the two cannot drift.

## Tabs, and the two §4 asked for that do not exist as data

§4 listed eight tabs. Six are built: পরিচিতি · ভর্তির ইতিহাস · হাজিরা ·
ফলাফল · ফি · নথি.

**Transfers** and **Certificates** were not built as separate tabs, because
neither is a separate thing in this schema. A transfer IS an enrolment row
whose status is `transferred` plus a `lifecycle_status` of `transferred_out`
— it already appears in the timeline, in the year it happened, which is where
someone looks for it. A certificate is generated on demand by R-5 and never
stored, so a Certificates tab would list one item that the নথি tab already
lists. Inventing two empty tabs to match a list would have been worse than
saying this.

The নথি tab lists what this viewer may **print**, and hands out no URLs — R-5
generates on demand, there is no object store, so §10's rule is satisfied by
there being nothing to leak. Asserted by sweeping the payload for `http`.

## Tests

- **33 endpoint tests** (`services/academics-svc/test/student-search.test.ts`)
  against a real PostgreSQL: the classifier and phone normaliser as pure
  functions, every search field, the lifecycle filter, alumni, pagination
  arithmetic across three pages, the four role scopes with signed tokens,
  privacy sweeps, and 404-not-403 for an id that exists but is invisible —
  with the assertion that a real-but-hidden id and a nonexistent one give the
  *same* answer.
- **13 SQL assertions** (`db/tests/student_search.sql`), wired into
  `.github/workflows/database.yml` including the idempotency re-run.
  Pre-cleans as well as tears down. The three hostile cases §12 names are one
  test each — Tenant B's code, a name that matches a Tenant B student, and
  Tenant B's guardian phone — plus the id named directly. The fixture gives
  **both schools a child called রাফি হাসান**, so a leak changes a count from
  1 to 2 and the test fails rather than passing on an empty table.
- Full gate: **865 tests across 11 workspaces, all passing** against a real
  PostgreSQL 16. All ten SQL suites green. `tsc` clean, `npm run build` ok,
  migration 044 verified down → up, 44/44 probed.

## Performance — measured, on 2,000 students

A seeded school: 2,000 students, 8,000 enrolments, 8,000 results, 15,240
attendance records, four academic years, 200 graduates.

End-to-end through the real handlers (p50 / p95 over 20 calls, warm):

| operation | p50 | p95 |
|---|---|---|
| search by student code | 4.6 ms | 6.3 ms |
| search by name (broad) | 11.9 ms | 13.1 ms |
| alumni filter, page 1 of 200 | 10.1 ms | 10.9 ms |
| alumni filter, page 8 (offset 175) | 10.5 ms | 12.4 ms |
| open one student, full history | 10.6 ms | 12.7 ms |

Pagination stays flat from page 1 to page 8. The master plan's exit criterion
is "under a second"; this is two orders under it.

**The honest caveat**: these are localhost against a local PostgreSQL. They
measure the database and the handler and nothing else. A school in Bangladesh
adds the round trip to Neon Singapore and a 2G/3G link, which will dominate
completely — the ~10 ms of work here is not what a person will wait for. What
the numbers do establish is that the queries are indexed and that adding
years and students does not degrade them.

## Browser verification

Demo preview, both the search and the record, at desktop and 375×812.

- **The brief's example, exactly**: `STU-8F39A271` → ১ জন পাওয়া গেছে → রাফি
  হাসান, উত্তীর্ণ → four years, ২০২৪ সপ্তম ক, ২০২৫ অষ্টম ঘ, ২০২৬ নবম ক, ২০২৭
  দশম খ, each with its own roll.
- **§6 current vs historical**: a currently-enrolled child renders under two
  headings — **বর্তমান ভর্তি** and **পূর্ববর্তী বছরসমূহ** — with the current
  year carrying a leading rule and bold weight. Three signals, never colour
  alone. A graduate correctly gets NO current section, because the flag comes
  from `enrolments.status` rather than from being last in the array.
- **All six tabs** render real content: profile, timeline, per-year attendance
  with percentages, per-year results, per-year fees plus receipts, and the
  printable-document list.
- **Role scope**, same broad query each time: principal → all matches,
  class teacher → 3 (their section), guardian → 1 (their child), student → 1
  (themselves).
- **Privacy**: as a subject teacher, no fees tab at all, and the profile ends
  with the sentence explaining the withheld fields.
- **States**: empty `কোনো শিক্ষার্থী পাওয়া যায়নি।`, too-short
  `অনুসন্ধানের জন্য অন্তত ২টি অক্ষর লিখুন।`, skeleton while loading, and a
  count line `N জন পাওয়া গেছে` with `aria-live`.
- **375×812**: zero horizontal page overflow; the six-tab strip scrolls
  sideways inside itself rather than wrapping to two lines.

## Known limitations

1. **Board numbers are not indexed.** `board_registration_no` and
   `board_roll_no` have no index, so that shape is a scan of one school's
   student table. Sub-millisecond at 2,000 students; a one-line migration if
   a school leans on it. Not added speculatively.
2. **The trigram indexes exist but the planner does not use them at this
   size.** Verified usable with `enable_seqscan = off` (bitmap index scan on
   `ix_users_name_trgm`); at 2,000 rows a seq scan is genuinely cheaper and
   the planner is right. They start winning as the table grows.
3. **Attendance history all lives in the DEFAULT partition.**
   `attendance_records` is range-partitioned by month with partitions only for
   2026-08…2026-10, so every earlier year falls into
   `attendance_records_default`. The per-student query is an index-only scan
   there and is fine; it is worth knowing before someone adds partitions.
4. **No date-range filter on the attendance tab.** §7 said "where practical";
   per-academic-year totals are what a person reading a history wants, and an
   arbitrary range picker on a summary view is a control without a question.
5. **No type-ahead suggestions.** §2 said "as the user types where
   appropriate". Search is submit-driven: on 2G, a request per keystroke is a
   cost the product's own SMS-frugality argument says not to pay. The request
   sequencing is already in place (`seq`) if this changes.
6. **The student-search tile is a fifth secondary card** on five staff
   dashboards, where the comment budgets "~6 tiles". Hiding R-6's main screen
   behind More would have failed D13's spirit and §18's own walk, which
   starts on it.

## Carried backlog — preserved per §22, none of it closed by R-6

class/section edit UI · guardian unlink workflow · audit export and
entity-name resolution · `POST /rms/solve` API-only by decision ·
**R-5: object storage** (no stored PDFs or student photos) ·
**R-5: CSV export** (`toCsv()` still unused) ·
**R-5: multi-card ID-card layout** (one card per A4 sheet) ·
**R-5: money formatting decision** (`৳ 1,300.00` in Latin digits beside
Bangla rolls — still open, still needs a call).

**R-7 — Onboarding & platform console.** Not started. R-6 stopped here as
instructed.

---

# 2026-08-29 · R-7 · Tenant onboarding & the platform console

**Status: complete.** A shikhonBD operator creates an institution through a
nine-step wizard and activates it, and the school's head teacher signs in with
a printed code. Measured end to end: **~250 ms of server work**, and no SQL
after the initial platform setup.

Two institutions were onboarded this way — মনিপুর উচ্চ বিদ্যালয় (school) and
মোহাম্মদপুর কলেজ (madrasah) — against a real PostgreSQL, through the real
endpoints.

## What already existed, and the one thing that did not

`tenants` has carried `plan_code`, `student_cap`, `trial_ends_on`, `status`,
`eiin`, `weekend_days`, `dek_wrapped` and `blind_index_pepper` since migration
001. `app.provision_tenant()` has seeded a school's academic spine since 012.
`audit.platform_access` has been waiting since 001. The activation-code login
has worked since 037.

What was missing was any way to **insert a tenant at all** — by design.
`tenant_self` is `USING (id = app.current_tenant())` and, with no separate
`WITH CHECK`, that expression governs INSERT too. So `shikhon_app` can only
write a tenant row whose id equals the tenant it is already inside: it cannot
create a school and cannot list one. That property is what the product's whole
isolation story rests on, and R-7 had to add the ability without spending it.

## The authorization chain, and three separate credentials

Migration 045 adds `app.create_tenant`, `app.platform_tenants`,
`app.set_tenant_status` and `app.log_platform_action` as SECURITY DEFINER with
a pinned `search_path`, granted to `shikhon_platform` and **explicitly revoked
from `shikhon_app`** — the same shape as `app.public_branding()` in 039.

platform-svc then needs three things a school does not have:

1. a **`super_admin` JWT** — a `principal` token is refused, and the DB suite
   asserts it;
2. **`PLATFORM_API_KEY`**, checked with a timing-safe compare, never in the
   browser bundle;
3. **`PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL`**, a different database role. Unset, the service
   answers 503 rather than falling back — a fallback to the runtime role is
   how a platform endpoint quietly becomes a tenant endpoint.

A wrong key and a missing key return the same code, so an attacker holding one
half learns nothing about the other.

### BYPASSRLS comes OFF, and that was a decision

Migration 001 created `shikhon_platform` with BYPASSRLS, back when it was a
role nothing could use. Giving it a login and leaving that on would have made
the one service that touches every school the one service where row-level
security does not apply — and `assertRlsEnforced` in server-core would have
refused to start against it, which is the boot guard doing its job.

It does not need it. The cross-tenant functions are DEFINER and run as the
owner; everything else the wizard does is work inside ONE school, and for that
it sets `app.tenant_id` and lives under the same policies as everybody else.
So a bug in the wizard cannot write into the wrong school.

That decision then produced three bugs, all of the same shape and all found by
running the thing: **a bare pool query sees nothing.** The tenant-detail
endpoint returned an empty branding object for a school that was branded; the
test's verification queries read every count as zero; and the fixture cleanup
deleted nothing and then failed on a duplicate slug. Each is now explicit
about the context it runs in, and each has a comment saying why.

## What the console is, and is not

A separate page, a separate bundle, a separate service, a separate database
role and a separate credential. `/platform`, `platform.js`, platform-svc,
`shikhon_platform`, `PLATFORM_API_KEY`. A school's device never downloads the
console's code.

It is also the one surface that **keeps** the shikhonBD brand (D11). The CI
guard now runs three ways: tenant surfaces must not carry the platform brand,
`index.html` must, and so must `platform.html` and `platform.ts`. One bundle
could not honestly be both white-labelled and shikhonBD-branded, which is the
strongest argument for it being a separate bundle.

Operator sign-in is two pasted secrets held in `sessionStorage` — not
`localStorage`, so a console left open on a shared laptop does not survive the
tab closing. Real operator SSO belongs with R-8's credential work; two pasted
secrets is an honest posture for a tool used by people who already hold the
deployment's environment.

## The state the operator sees is DERIVED, never stored

§23 asks the operator to see how far a half-finished school got. The obvious
implementation is a stage column the wizard updates, and it is the wrong one:
a stored stage is exactly what goes stale when provisioning dies between the
act and the bookkeeping — which is the failure §22 is about.

`app.tenant_onboarding_state()` counts the real rows instead: years, grading
bands, classes, sections, subjects, fee heads, teachers, students, guardians,
admins. It cannot disagree with the database because it IS the database, and
after a crash it reports what landed rather than what someone meant to land.

The console renders it as a checklist where every line carries a tick or a
warning **and** the count **and** the note — never colour alone (F-812). Three
lines are labelled `সক্রিয় করতে আবশ্যক`, and the grading-scale line says why:
*না থাকলে প্রথম ফলাফল প্রকাশ ব্যর্থ হবে.*

## The gaps this phase found

Four of them, and two would have stopped a pilot.

### 1. Nothing had ever written `student_profiles`

R-6 built search-by-permanent-ID against `student_profiles.student_code`, and
it turned out **no code in the product had ever inserted a row into that
table** — not the student import, not enrolment, not any endpoint. It has held
the permanent identifier since migration 001 and only test fixtures had put
anything in it. So R-6's search worked and had nothing to find.

The import is where a student first exists, so that is where the profile and
the code are now created: `STU-` plus eight hex from the user's own uuid,
derived so it is stable and needs no counter.

### 2. A provisioned school could not import a single student

`provision_tenant` seeds the year, terms, grading bands, bell schedule,
classes, `class_subjects`, fee heads and the chart of accounts — everything
except the `subject_templates` that F-304's `app.derive_student_subjects()`
requires. Nothing in the product had ever created a `curriculum_schemes` or
`subject_templates` row either.

So a freshly onboarded school rejected **every row** of its first student
import with `৯ শ্রেণির বিষয় তালিকা (টেমপ্লেট) তৈরি হয়নি`. The pilot runbook's
step 6 would have hit the same wall.

`app.provision_curriculum()` closes it, deriving the templates from the
`class_subjects` `provision_tenant` already populated — it adds no curriculum
knowledge of its own, it reshapes what is there. It is a separate function
rather than an edit to `provision_tenant` because that function is exercised
by six phases of tests and this one can be re-run against a school provisioned
before R-7.

### 3. `student_cap` was decoration

Declared in migration 001 with a CHECK that it is positive, and enforced
nowhere: not on enrolment, not on import, not at all. A school on a
500-student plan could import 5,000.

It is now a statement-level trigger on `enrolments` — statement-level because
an 800-row import is one INSERT and a row trigger would count the school 800
times. It is on `enrolments` rather than `student_profiles` because, per (1),
nothing wrote the latter. The refusal states both numbers: *capped at 2
students and this would make 3*.

### 4. My own regression, caught by the browser walk

Extracting the activation-code alphabet, length and HMAC into a shared module
so the wizard could issue a school's first code left `CODE_LEN` undefined in
the redeem path — a ReferenceError surfacing as a **500 on the one login a
brand-new school has**. identity-svc's ten tests all passed through it,
because none of them redeems a code. There is now a test that does, and it
asserts the round trip and the single-use property.

Two smaller ones: `parseBranding` fills DEFAULTS for absent fields, so saving
`{nameBn, primaryColor}` would have written `nameEn: "Institution"` over every
school's real English name — only supplied keys are persisted now. And
`app.provision_curriculum` was not idempotent on its first pass: the unique
index on `subject_templates` includes a nullable `group_code`, and PostgreSQL
treats NULLs as DISTINCT unless the index says `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`, so
`ON CONFLICT` matched nothing and a re-run doubled every ungrouped template
(3 → 6). It uses `NOT EXISTS … IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` now, and the DB suite
asserts a re-run changes nothing.

## Reuse, not reimplementation

Three things the wizard needed already existed inside an endpoint that
required a tenant session the operator does not have. All three were
**extracted**, not copied:

- `services/academics-svc/src/import-run.ts` — the import orchestration.
  `api/import.ts` is now a thin handler over it and gained `kind:'teacher'`.
  The alternative was minting the operator an impersonation token, or a second
  importer that would eventually disagree with the first about what a phone
  number looks like.
- `services/identity-svc/src/activation.ts` — the code alphabet, length and
  HMAC. Three definitions that must agree exactly; one copy.
- The R-1 branding parser is the validator for the console's branding step, so
  it cannot accept something the school's own editor would reject.

Teacher import is new (`teacher-import.ts`), deliberately the same shape as
the student importer, and deliberately **does not assign anybody to a section
or subject** — R-7.6: a teacher exists first and is assigned second, and the
assignment is a dated record R-3's screen can end and replace.

## Two doors, and the second one is the hostname

`app.public_branding()` has accepted a slug OR a tenant id since migration
039, precisely so a vanity URL could work later without a third identifier.
`tenantKeyFromHost()` reads the subdomain label and uses it as that key:

    monipur-high-school.shikhonbd.com  →  monipur-high-school

`?tid=` keeps working and keeps **priority** — it is printed on admission slips
and baked into installed PWAs, and a subdomain that overrode it would break
every device already in a school's hands. The label is not cached, because the
hostname supplies it on every visit and caching it would leave the wrong
school's key on a device that later opened a different subdomain. Labels that
are never a school (`www`, `app`, `platform`, `api`) are excluded.

**Wildcard DNS and TLS are a deployment step, not a code one.** The resolver
ships; `*.shikhonbd.com` and its certificate are recorded in the deployment
doc as the remaining action. Nothing in the product depends on them — the
`?tid=` door is unchanged.

## Slugs

Generated from the English name, lowercased, non-alphanumeric runs collapsed
to one hyphen: `Monipur High School` → `monipur-high-school`. On collision the
console offers a **district suffix, never a number** — this becomes the
school's web address and `monipur-high-2` is not a URL anyone prints on an
admission slip. The field carries a permanent quiet warning that it cannot be
changed once printed.

## Tests

- **25 endpoint tests** (`services/platform-svc/test/platform.test.ts`) against
  a real PostgreSQL: a principal refused, each credential alone refused, both
  refusals indistinguishable, validation before any write, slug collision
  without naming the other school, activation blocked on the two silent
  failures, provisioning idempotent, branding not overwritten with
  placeholders, the same phone granted rather than duplicated, a platform role
  never grantable to a school, dry-run writing nothing, digest mismatch
  refused, siblings collapsed to one guardian, the cap refusing with both
  numbers, the derived state, suspend/restore losing nothing, the audit trail,
  and the activation round trip.
- **15 SQL assertions** (`db/tests/platform.sql`), wired into CI including the
  idempotency re-run: the runtime role cannot create, enumerate, suspend or
  forge an audit row; the platform role can log in and is still bound by RLS;
  the audit trail is readable and not directly writable; a school sees no
  other even by id; provisioning is idempotent; the cap states both numbers;
  suspension is reversible and lossless.
- **`scripts/r7-acceptance.mjs`** — the §28 walk as a repeatable script.
- Full gate: **890 tests across 12 workspaces, all passing** against a real
  PostgreSQL 16. All eleven SQL suites green (134 assertions). `tsc` clean,
  `npm run build` ok, migration 045 verified down → up, 45/45 probed, D11
  guard green in all three directions.

## Browser verification

`/platform` in a real browser, against the real API and the real database.

- **Sign-in** with the two pasted credentials; the institution list renders
  §18's columns — institution, type, slug, status, plan, students/cap, trial
  end, created — and **no student-level PII**.
- **The nine-step wizard**, clicked through: the rail marks done steps with a
  tick and the current one with `aria-current`; the slug auto-filled as
  `monipur-high-school`; the tenant was written at step 3 (`প্রতিষ্ঠান তৈরি
  হয়েছে`); provisioning showed its counts verbatim, including
  `(grading_bands,7)`, which is how an operator knows the scale exists.
- **Both institutions onboarded end to end** — 249 ms and 208 ms of server
  work. The madrasah defaulted to a **Friday-only weekend** `{5}` against the
  school's `{5,6}`, and got a different curriculum (34 subject mappings
  against 48): institution type behaving as configuration, visibly.
- **Isolation**: inside each school, exactly one tenant row is visible, its
  own four students, and zero of the other's — including when the other's id
  is named directly.
- **The head teacher logs in.** The activation code from step 7 redeemed
  through `/auth/activate` and returned a session with role `principal`. This
  is R-7's exit criterion and it is the one thing a wizard cannot fake.
- **The console's own states**: skeletons while loading, an error state with a
  retry that recovered from an expired operator token, an empty state on the
  list, and per-field validation messages in Bangla.

The first screenshot of the console was **unreadable** — dark text on black.
`--c-bg` is not a defined token anywhere in the design system, and this
stylesheet is the third place to use it; `app.css` already carries a comment
about the same bug in `.chat-form`. Both remaining uses are fixed, and the
console now sets `data-theme` from the operator's own machine, because dark
mode here is an explicit attribute rather than a media query.

## Known limitations

1. **Wildcard DNS and TLS are not provisioned.** The hostname→slug resolver
   ships and is unit-testable; pointing `*.shikhonbd.com` at the deployment
   and issuing the certificate is a deployment action, recorded in
   06-DEPLOYMENT.md. `?tid=` is unaffected.
2. **Operator sign-in is two pasted secrets.** No SSO, no operator account
   management, no key rotation UI. Deliberate: R-8 owns credentials.
3. **`plan_code` is a label.** No feature gating — `tenants.features` exists
   for that later. `student_cap` and `trial_ends_on` are enforced and shown;
   billing the school stays manual, per R-7.10.
4. **Trial expiry is not automatic.** `trial_ends_on` is stored, shown in the
   console, and moves nothing on its own. The master plan says expiry moves a
   tenant to `suspended`; scheduling that belongs with the maintenance cron
   and is not built.
5. **The wizard's branding step is a subset** — colour, head teacher, phone.
   Logo, favicon, watermark and signature upload remain the school's own R-1
   editor, which is where they were always going to be done and where the
   school has the files.
6. **Groups are not configurable per class in the wizard.** `provision_tenant`
   derives a class's group from the NCTB template; a school wanting Science
   and Humanities sections of class 9 creates them in R-3's structure screen.
   §11's tree is therefore read from what provisioning made, not authored in
   the wizard.
7. **The activation code's `issued_by` points at the account itself.** That
   column FKs to `users` — a person inside the school — and for a school's
   first account there is nobody inside the school yet. The truthful record of
   which operator issued it is the `audit.platform_access` row. Same division
   for `import_batches.started_by`.
8. **platform-svc is the 11th of the Hobby plan's 12 functions.** One spare.

## Carried backlog — preserved per §33, none of it closed by R-7

**R-3:** class/section edit UI · guardian unlink workflow · audit export and
entity-name resolution · `POST /rms/solve` API-only by decision.

**R-5:** object storage (no stored PDFs or student photos) · CSV export
(`toCsv()` still unused) · multi-card ID-card layout (one card per A4 sheet) ·
**money-formatting decision** (`৳ 1,300.00` in Latin digits beside Bangla
rolls — still open, still needs a call).

**R-6:** an index on the board registration/roll columns if a school leans on
that search shape · an attendance date-range filter · type-ahead suggestions.

## Unresolved bugs / issues

None open.

## Next recommended step

**R-8 — go-live unlocks (credentials & production posture).** Not started.
R-7 stopped here as instructed. R-8 is where the SMS aggregator, the object
storage credential, operator SSO and the wildcard certificate land — and where
`LOGIN_DISABLED` is finally flipped, which R-7 deliberately did not touch.

---

# 2026-08-29 · R-8 · Go-live unlocks

**Status: complete, with an honest boundary.** Four capabilities the master
plan lists under R-8 are now real code, tested and walked in a browser: a
**live SMS provider** behind an adapter with delivery reports, **environment
switches** replacing three hardcoded `const`s, **AI budget enforcement**, and a
**readiness screen** that reports the deployment's actual state.

The rest of the master plan's R-8 list is not code and could not be closed by
writing any: an aggregator contract, an MFS merchant agreement, a
data-residency decision, and pilot schools. Those are named on the readiness
screen itself, under a heading saying that screen cannot tick them — see
"What R-8 could not close" below. Reporting them done because a switch exists
for them is precisely the failure this phase was supposed to prevent.

The first real OTP login in the product's history happened during this phase's
browser acceptance: a principal signed in with a code that travelled through
`sms_outbox`, an SSL Wireless adapter, an aggregator, and back as a delivery
report.

## What was actually dark, and it was worse than "unconfigured"

The master plan describes R-8 as "contracts, credentials, and switches —
everything here is built and dark". That is true of the schema. It was not true
of the code, and the gap ran in the dangerous direction: **three things the
plan assumed were built and waiting for a credential did not exist at all.**

### 1. There was no provider to configure

`sms_outbox` has carried `provider`, `provider_msg_id`, `delivered_at`,
`error_code` and `cost_bdt` since migration 004. The dispatcher had a
`sendStub` that logged. There was no seam — no interface, no adapter, nothing a
credential could have been plugged into. "Add the aggregator's token to the
environment" would have changed nothing at all.

`services/sms-svc/src/provider.ts` is that seam: an `SmsProvider` interface, a
`StubProvider` that stays the default, and an `SslWirelessProvider`.
`resolveProvider()` **throws** when a provider is named without credentials
rather than falling back to the stub — a school that believes its messages are
going out is worse off than one that knows they are not.

### 2. Nothing had ever received a delivery report

`delivered_at` had never been written by anything, in any deployment, ever. The
product knew only that it had HANDED a message to a provider, which is not what
a school is asking when it rings to ask whether the SMS went out.

`POST /api/v1/sms/dlr` closes that. It has **its own secret**,
`SMS_DLR_SECRET`, not `SERVICE_API_KEY`: this endpoint is called by a vendor,
and handing a vendor the service key would make every internal endpoint
reachable by them. Unset, it answers **503, not 401** — an unconfigured webhook
and a wrong password send an operator to two different places.

It takes **no tenant from the caller**. A DLR carries a provider message id and
nothing else we can trust; the row is found by that id and the tenant comes
from the row. That needs a cross-tenant read the runtime role rightly cannot
do, so `app.record_sms_delivery()` (migration 046) is `SECURITY DEFINER` for
exactly that, and updates **only the four delivery columns**. A provider cannot
change a message's body, its recipient, or which school it belongs to.
`db/tests/go_live.sql` asserts that by comparing every other column before and
after.

### 3. The OTP switch turned on a login that delivered nothing

This is the one that would have hurt. `services/identity-svc/api/otp-request.ts`
wrote the code to `console.log` under a comment reading *"Stub SMS send — real
aggregator integration is a follow-up."*

Survivable while the switch was a hardcoded `false`. Not survivable once the
switch became an environment variable: an operator could set
`OTP_SENDING_ENABLED=true`, watch the readiness screen go green on both OTP and
SMS, hand a school a login — and **no code would reach anybody**. The screen
would have been lying in the exact way this phase exists to prevent.

The code now goes into `sms_outbox` in the **same transaction as the
challenge**, so there is never a code the product believes it sent. It is
queued at `priority = 1`, because a login code behind a queue of attendance
notices is a login code that arrives after it has expired.

Two details are tested because both would otherwise be discovered one school at
a time:

- **The dedupe key is the challenge, not the phone and the day.**
  `uq_sms_dedupe` is `UNIQUE (tenant_id, created_on, dedupe_key)`. Keyed on
  phone+day, the person who did not receive the first code could not be sent
  another until tomorrow — the exact person who needs one.
- **The message is signed with the SCHOOL's name** (D11), falling back to the
  neutral `বিদ্যালয়` and never to the platform's. A guardian must not read
  their software vendor's brand on a message from their child's school.

## The switches

`packages/server-core/src/go-live.ts` is the single source. Three hardcoded
constants became environment reads:

| was | now |
|---|---|
| `login-view.ts`: `export const LOGIN_DISABLED = true` | `isLoginDisabled()` ← the server's `otpLogin` |
| `otp-request.ts`: `const OTP_SENDING_ENABLED = false` | `otpSendingEnabled()` |
| `finance-svc`: `const MFS_PAYMENTS_ENABLED = false` | `mfsPaymentsEnabled()` |

Only the word `true` enables anything — case-insensitively, because `TRUE` is
unambiguously somebody deciding, while `1`, `yes`, `on` and `enabled` all
resolve **off**. That is the safe direction to be wrong in: a switch that
stayed off gets reported by an operator; a switch that turned itself on gets
reported by a parent who received a text at midnight.

The client no longer carries its own copy of the OTP flag.
`GET /api/v1/ops/brand` — the call the login screen already makes before anyone
types anything — now carries `otpLogin` on **both** branches, and `branding.ts`
caches it. What used to be "edit a server file, edit a browser file, rebuild,
redeploy, in that order, without forgetting either" is now one environment
variable.

## AI budget: a table nobody read

`ai_budget_periods` has existed since migration 008 with `token_budget`,
`tokens_used`, `soft_limit_notified_at` and `hard_limit_hit_at`, and
`tenants.ai_monthly_token_budget` since 001. **Nothing in ai-svc referenced
either.** It recorded `input_tokens`/`output_tokens` on `ai_turns` and never
looked at what a school was allowed to spend — the same shape as `student_cap`
before R-7: a limit only the price list knew about.

`app.consume_ai_budget()` **reserves before the call** and
`app.settle_ai_budget()` corrects it after. Reserving first is the point: a
check-then-record would let a school overshoot by however many requests are in
flight, and an AI bill is the one cost in this product that can run away
between two cron ticks. Both are `SECURITY INVOKER` — a school's own budget is
not a cross-tenant concern, and making them DEFINER would have handed one
school a lever on another's counter.

Refusal is **402, not 403**. The school has not done anything wrong and the fix
is commercial.

Verified by hand against real PostgreSQL before any UI existed, then pinned in
`db/tests/go_live.sql`: 8,500 of 10,000 allowed and the soft limit stamped; the
next call refused, the hard limit stamped, and `tokens_used` still 8,500 —
**a refused call is not charged.**

## The readiness screen

`GET /api/v1/platform/readiness` computes eight checks from the environment;
`apps/pwa/src/platform.ts` renders them under আবশ্যক / ঐচ্ছিক. Same binary, two
environments, verified in a browser:

- default deployment → **৪ টি আবশ্যক সেটিং বাকি আছে** (`blockingRemaining: 4`)
- switches set → **সব আবশ্যক সেটিং প্রস্তুত** (`blockingRemaining: 0`)

No rebuild between them. It reports **presence, never values** — a test asserts
that no secret's value appears anywhere in the response; the sender id and
provider name do appear, because they are not secret.

It distinguishes *broken* from *off*: a provider named with incomplete
credentials reads `ক্রেডেনশিয়াল অসম্পূর্ণ`, which is a mistake, not a decision.

## What R-8 could not close

The screen carries a card headed **এই পর্দা যা জানে না** naming what no
environment variable can answer:

1. **The aggregator contract.** A masking sender id and a rate need a signed
   agreement with SSL Wireless or a competitor. The adapter is written and
   tested against a fake aggregator; the contract is a commercial act.
2. **The MFS merchant agreement.** bKash/Nagad merchant onboarding. The switch
   exists; no gateway was invented, per the phase's own constraint.
3. **The data-residency decision.** Where a Bangladeshi school's student data
   physically sits is a policy decision with legal weight, not a config value.
4. **Pilot schools.** Real institutions with real children.

These are reported as **not done**. A tick beside any of them would be the lie
this phase was written to prevent.

## Migration 046

Three functions, no tables, no columns. Rollback
`db/rollback/046_go_live_unlocks.down.sql` loses no data — a message reported
delivered keeps its `delivered_at` and its `cost_bdt`. Full cycle exercised:
**up → 12 assertions pass → down → the suite correctly fails (functions gone) →
up → 12 assertions pass.** Suite re-run twice for idempotency, and wired into
`.github/workflows/database.yml` in both the main and re-run passes.

`scripts/migration-status.mjs` probes `app.record_sms_delivery` for 046.

## Secrets

`scripts/check-secrets.mjs` did not know `PLATFORM_API_KEY` (R-7) or R-8's
`SMS_API_TOKEN` and `SMS_DLR_SECRET`. Registering the secrets a go-live needs
is this phase's own job, so all three were added with blast radius and rotation
notes. `SMS_API_TOKEN`'s entropy floor is 64 bits rather than 128: it is set by
the aggregator, and demanding more of somebody else's key would fail every real
deployment.

## Tests

**932 across 12 workspaces with a database attached, 693 without, all passing.**
New in R-8:

| suite | what it holds |
|---|---|
| `services/sms-svc/test/provider.test.ts` (9) | the stub stays the default; a named provider without credentials **throws**; HTTP 200 with a failure body is a failure |
| `services/sms-svc/test/dlr.test.ts` (11) | 503-vs-401; the service key does **not** open this door; an unknown status is not guessed at |
| `packages/server-core/test/go-live.test.ts` (12) | only `true` enables; no secret **value** in the readiness report |
| `services/identity-svc/test/otp-request.test.ts` (10) | the code is queued, not logged; signed with the school; a resend is not swallowed |
| `db/tests/go_live.sql` (12) | a report changes only the four delivery columns; a refused AI call is not charged |

Three fixture defects were fixed rather than worked around, and two are lessons
earlier phases already learned:

- **RLS ate a cleanup again.** `DELETE FROM tenants WHERE id = ANY([T, OTHER])`
  under tenant T's context deletes only T — the other row is invisible, the
  DELETE matches nothing, and the next run fails on a duplicate key from a
  fixture it believes it deleted. Third time this pattern has bitten (twice in
  R-7).
- **F-102 is real in tests.** OTP requests are capped at 3/hour per phone and
  the buckets live in the database, outliving the process. The suite now uses a
  fresh number per test and a fresh series per run — the policy was not
  weakened to accommodate it.
- **An open pool failed a whole file.** `dlr.test.ts` stops before its own
  query, but the rate limiter runs first and really connects when
  `DATABASE_URL` is set; the singleton pool kept the process alive and the
  runner reported the file as failed with no assertion to point at.

## Browser verification

Two deployments of the same binary, one database, verified in a real browser:

1. **Readiness, switches off** — 4 blocking items, each with a reason.
2. **Readiness, switches on** — all blocking items green, `ssl_wireless` and
   sender id `SHIKHON` shown, token not.
3. **Mobile (375×812)** — both columns wrap, `scrollWidth === clientWidth`, no
   horizontal overflow.
4. **App, switches off** — demo mode, exactly as before R-8.
5. **App, switches on, cold device** — the real OTP login screen.
6. **A full login** — phone → code → dispatched through a fake aggregator →
   `প্রধান` signed into নথি বিদ্যালয় with the school's own branding.
7. **The refusal path** — a number with no account gets
   `এই নম্বরে কোনো অ্যাকাউন্ট পাওয়া যায়নি` at verification, while the
   *request* step deliberately does not reveal whether a number is registered.
8. **A delivery report** — `{"ok":true,"matched":true}`, row `delivered`,
   `cost_bdt = 0.3500`.

### Two defects the browser found that the tests did not

Both were mine, and both were invisible to unit tests:

1. **`fetchPublicBranding` returned early when the URL named no tenant**, so
   `otpLogin` was never learned on a bare domain and the app stayed in demo
   mode however the server was configured. The switch is a property of the
   DEPLOYMENT, not of a school, so it is now fetched on both paths.
2. **A cold device could not know the answer in time.** The demo-mode gate
   reads a cache a first-ever visitor has never filled. Reading "unknown" as
   "off" is safe on the login screen — it offers the activation-code path — and
   is *not* safe at that gate, where it drops a real visitor into a sample
   school. `otpLoginAnswered()` distinguishes "cached false" from "never
   asked", and a cold device now asks once before deciding. Every later boot is
   synchronous, which is what keeps the 2G start immediate.

A third, smaller: `isLoginDisabled()` was a module-level `const`, captured
before the cold fetch resolved — it froze a newly live school on "OTP login is
temporarily off" until someone reloaded. Now read per call.

And a fourth, the same bug R-6 shipped, one funnel-step earlier: `5 মিনিটের` —
a Latin digit in Bangla prose. The duration is now `৫`. The **code** stays in
Latin digits deliberately: it is not prose, it is a literal to be typed back,
and a person reading `৯৯৫৯৪৭` off an SMS has to transliterate it first.

## Offline classification

Deliberate and recorded: **none of R-8's four capabilities is offline-capable,
and none should be.**

- The **readiness screen** reports a live server environment. A cached answer
  would be a stale claim about production posture, which is worse than no
  answer.
- The **DLR** is inbound from a vendor to the server; a browser is not
  involved.
- **OTP request/verify** require the network by definition — the code travels
  over a network the device must also be on.
- The **AI budget** must be reserved server-side before the call. A
  client-side reservation is not a reservation.

The activation-code path remains the offline-tolerant way into the product, and
is untouched by this phase.

## Known limitations

1. **No aggregator contract**, so `SMS_PROVIDER` is unset on every real
   deployment and the stub is what runs. Verified end to end against a fake
   aggregator on localhost, which proves the adapter and not the vendor.
2. **`SslWirelessProvider` is written to one vendor's documented shape and has
   never met the real endpoint.** The `csms_id`/`reference_id` mapping and the
   status vocabulary are the two things most likely to need a correction on
   first contact; both are isolated to `provider.ts` and the DLR's status map.
3. **Cost is recorded only when the DLR reports it.** The send response does
   not carry a per-message cost and none is invented, so `cost_bdt` stays NULL
   on a deployment whose aggregator does not send delivery reports.
4. **No SMS retry backoff.** A failed send stays `queued` with an `error_code`
   and is retried on the next dispatcher tick, up to 5 attempts, then `failed`.
   The tick is the interval; there is no exponential backoff.
5. **The AI soft limit stamps a timestamp and notifies nobody.**
   `soft_limit_notified_at` is set at 80%; wiring it to R-2's notification
   infrastructure is not built. A principal learns of it by being refused.
6. **Trial expiry still moves nothing** (carried from R-7.4).
7. **Operator sign-in is still two pasted secrets** (carried from R-7.2). R-8
   was expected to own operator SSO; it does not, and that is stated here
   rather than quietly dropped.
8. **Wildcard DNS and TLS remain unprovisioned** (carried from R-7.1).

## Carried backlog — preserved, none of it closed by R-8

**R-3:** class/section edit UI · guardian unlink workflow · audit export and
entity-name resolution · `POST /rms/solve` API-only by decision.

**R-5:** object storage (no stored PDFs or student photos) · CSV export
(`toCsv()` still unused) · multi-card ID-card layout (one card per A4 sheet) ·
**money-formatting decision** (`৳ 1,300.00` in Latin digits beside Bangla
rolls — still open, still needs a call).

**R-6:** an index on the board registration/roll columns if a school leans on
that search shape · an attendance date-range filter · type-ahead suggestions.

**R-7:** operator SSO and key rotation · trial expiry automation · per-class
group configuration in the wizard · logo/favicon/watermark upload in the
wizard.

**R-8 (new):** SMS retry backoff · soft-limit notification wired to R-2 ·
per-message cost when an aggregator reports it on send rather than on delivery.

## Unresolved bugs / issues

**1. `GET /api/v1/sync/pull` is built, mounted, tested — and no client ever
calls it.**

Flagged for the record, and deliberately **not** pulled into R-8: R-8 touches
nothing in the sync path, and the master plan does not name this as an R-8
dependency.

The state, precisely: `services/sync-svc/api/pull.ts` implements the
delta-cursor protocol, `index.ts` mounts it, and sync-svc's suites cover it.
The only mention anywhere in the client is a service-worker **routing rule**
declaring the caching strategy (`network-only`) for a URL nothing requests,
plus that rule's test. `transport.ts` calls `/api/v1/sync/push` and nothing
else.

So the outbox pushes, and the client never pulls. Every read the app performs
comes from ordinary REST endpoints with their own caching, which is why nothing
is visibly broken — the delta protocol is simply unused. Two honest resolutions
exist and this phase chose neither: wire the client to it, or delete the
endpoint and its documentation. Leaving it is a third option and the worst one,
because `docs/01-ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/03-API-SPECIFICATIONS.md` both
describe it as the product's sync mechanism.

## Next recommended step

**R-9.** Not started. R-8 stopped here as instructed.

The two things that would most change the product's readiness are not R-9 work
and are not code: the aggregator contract, which makes every SMS path in this
phase real rather than rehearsed, and a pilot school.

---

# 2026-08-29 · R-9 · Web push notifications

**Status: complete for one of R-9's seven items, and explicit about the other
six.** A parent, teacher or student can turn on notifications for their own
device; a school notice reaches them over the internet instead of by SMS; and a
school that opts in stops paying for the SMS that push carried.

Verified end to end against a real HTTP push service: the notice was encrypted
per RFC 8291, sent with a real VAPID header, received, and **decrypted back to
the school's own name in Bangla** — with the SMS row marked `suppressed` and no
other tenant able to see any of it.

## What the Master Plan defines as R-9, and what was actually there

> Section chat (moderated, section-scoped, teacher present), web push
> notifications (cuts SMS cost — the biggest infra line), content authoring
> workspace (F-403) + NCTB corpus ingestion (F-1301) to light up grounded AI,
> photo/voice submissions (F-902), report trend charts (F-1505), native app
> wrappers, library/transport/hostel/payroll.

Seven items, audited against the repository rather than against the roadmap's
own words:

| Item | State in the repo | Blocked by |
|---|---|---|
| Section chat | Nothing. No table, endpoint or view. | The plan itself calls it **optional**; moderation/safety design |
| **Web push** | Nothing. No table, no VAPID, no `pushManager`, no SW `push` handler. | **nothing** |
| Content authoring (F-403) | Not built. `topics`/`topic_blocks` reachable only by direct INSERT; every *consumer* exists. | — (large, code-only) |
| NCTB corpus (F-1301) | Half. Retrieval path exists, no corpus ingested. | **External**: the corpus, an embedding key |
| Photo/voice (F-902) | Half. `038_submission_media` has the metadata and the presign *contract*; **no object-storage client exists anywhere**. | **External**: R2/S3 credential (open R-5 backlog) |
| Trend charts (F-1505) | Not built. `class-perf-view` answers a different question. | — |
| Native wrappers | Nothing. | **External**: store accounts |
| Library/transport/hostel/payroll | Nothing. | — (four new product areas) |

### The discrepancy, recorded before deciding

**R-9's stated dependency is a pilot, and there is no pilot.** The sequence
table reads `| R-9 | Add-ons | — | pilot | — |`, and R-8 closed with pilot
schools explicitly open and externally blocked. Read literally, R-9 cannot
start. Read usefully: the items that do not depend on pilot feedback can be
built, and the ones that are genuinely pilot-shaped — native wrappers, four new
product modules — should not be guessed at in their absence.

Also found: **`docs/09-PRD-AUDIT.md` is stale** (2026-08-12, pre-R-1…R-8). It
still says dark mode is unbuilt, that F-1310 has no cost ceiling (R-8 built the
AI budget), and that `LOGIN_DISABLED` is a constant (R-8 made it an env switch).
Not rewritten wholesale — out of scope — but noted so it is not read as current.

## Why web push, and not the rest

- It is the **only** item the plan gives a business reason for — "cuts SMS cost,
  the biggest infra line" — and R-8 is what made that cost real: there is now an
  actual provider, an actual per-message cost, and a delivery report recording
  it. The saving is measurable against R-8's own work rather than asserted.
- It is the **only** item with **no external dependency**. VAPID keys are
  self-issued by a script in this repository. There is no vendor, no contract,
  no merchant account, no corpus, no store listing.
- It **reuses** R-2's audience resolution and R-8's dispatcher wholesale.

Items 3, 6 and 8 are code-only and deliberately not attempted: doing push
properly — crypto, service worker, permission UX, cost suppression, isolation —
is the phase. They are recorded as open, not as done.

## The crypto is hand-written, and that is the point

`web-push` on npm would have done this in three lines. It is also ~15
transitive dependencies in the path of a message sent to a child's parent, in a
codebase whose server depends on `pg` and `jose` and nothing else.

Everything needed — P-256 ECDH, HKDF-SHA256, AES-128-GCM, an ES256 signature —
is in `node:crypto`. It came to about 120 lines. The decisive argument was not
size: **both RFCs publish worked examples with fixed keys and a fixed expected
output**, so the implementation is asserted against the *specification* rather
than against its own previous output. A snapshot of my own bytes would pass
just as happily if every one of them were wrong.

`db/tests/…` cannot check this, so `web-push.test.ts` does: RFC 8291 §5's vector
matches byte for byte. It passed on the first run, which is the only reassuring
thing about writing your own crypto.

Getting it wrong would not have failed loudly. A push service accepts a
malformed body with a 201 and the browser silently fails to decrypt, so the
symptom is "some parents never get notifications" — reported weeks later by
somebody who assumed they had turned them off by accident.

## The endpoint is globally unique, and that is a security property

`push_subscriptions.endpoint` is `UNIQUE` across every tenant. Not tidiness:

A push endpoint identifies a **browser**, not a person. Two users at two
different schools sharing one device and one origin — a school office computer,
a shared family phone — receive the SAME endpoint from the push service. If both
rows were allowed to exist, school A would go on pushing to a browser now used
by school B's parent, and B's parent would read A's notices on their lock
screen. No amount of RLS prevents it, because both rows are individually
legitimate inside their own tenant.

So: one row per endpoint, and whoever most recently proved they are signed in on
that device owns it. Claiming it deletes the previous owner's row, which
necessarily crosses tenants — hence `app.claim_push_subscription()`, SECURITY
DEFINER for exactly that one DELETE. It takes **no tenant and no user
argument**: both come from the session, so there is nothing a caller could
supply to redirect the row, and it re-checks active membership because DEFINER
means RLS is not doing it. `db/tests/web_push.sql` §4 is the test.

## Not even the principal

Layer 2 on this table is **owner-only**, a deliberate departure from every other
table in the product. Management can see who received a notice, who was absent,
who paid. A push endpoint is different in kind: it is a **capability** — whoever
holds it can put a notification on that person's phone — and no question the
office has to answer requires it. The API never returns one either; the screen
gets a 12-character fingerprint, enough to identify a row for deletion.

`app.is_system_ingest()` is admitted for the sender, the same narrow admission
migration 010 makes for the outbound-delivery worker on `sms_outbox`.

## The saving, and the order that makes it safe

Push is a second **transport** on the existing pipeline, not a second pipeline.
It sits between enqueueing and sending and asks one question of each queued
message: *could this have gone to a browser instead?*

**Push is attempted first, and the SMS is cancelled only once a push service has
accepted the message.** The other order — cancel, then try — loses the message
whenever push fails, and it fails for ordinary reasons: a revoked permission, an
uninstalled browser, an outage. A failed push therefore costs a few
milliseconds; the row stays `queued` and goes out as SMS a moment later. A
school is never worse off than before R-9, only cheaper when push works.

No new table: `sms_outbox.status` already had `'suppressed'`, so a cancelled SMS
stays an honest record of what the school did not pay for, with
`error_code = 'delivered_by_push'`.

**Two things are never suppressed.** An emergency notice — "school is closed
today" should arrive by every route available, and it is the one message worth
paying twice for. And anything `auth.*`: a person requesting a login code may
well be doing so *because* they have lost access to the app that would have
received the push.

**Suppression is opt-in per school, default off.** Replacing an SMS with a push
is a judgement about a school's parents, not a technical fact: a notification
can be muted at the OS level or land on a phone the parent has handed to the
child. Until a school opts in, push is purely additive, and the dispatcher
reports `couldHaveSuppressed` — what opting in would have saved, which is the
number that makes the case for it.

## Two defects, one of them older than this phase

### 1. A screen that loaded forever

`navigator.serviceWorker.ready` resolves when there is an ACTIVE worker, and
when registration has failed it does not resolve **at all**. Not slowly: never.
It has no rejection path.

So on any browser where the service worker fails to register — a corporate
policy, some private-window modes, a failed update — the notification screen sat
on its loading skeleton permanently, with no error and no way out.

Found in a real browser within a minute. The unit tests could not see it: they
inject a client rather than touching `navigator`. Fixed with `getRegistration()`
on the read path, which settles either way, and a bounded race on the subscribe
path, which genuinely needs `.ready`. The regression test hands the client a
promise that never resolves.

### 2. A setting that had never saved (pre-existing, R-3)

The settings endpoint wrote with
`jsonb_set(settings, '{sms,noticeMaxChars}', …, true)`, and `create_missing`
creates the **last** element of a path, never the object that would contain it:

```
jsonb_set('{}', '{sms,noticeMaxChars}', '180', true)  →  {}
```

On any school whose `settings` had never held an `sms` object — every freshly
provisioned one — the PUT returned 200, the screen said সংরক্ষিত, and **nothing
was written**. The next visit showed the default, which reads like somebody
changing their mind rather than like a defect.

It survived from R-3 because **there was no test file for that endpoint at
all**. R-9 hit it on the first save, because `push` is a key that never
pre-exists. Fixed with a `||` merge at both levels; both keys now persist, and
neither clobbers the other or the branding stored beside them. A 13-test suite
now exists, and it asserts against the **column** rather than the response —
the response was right all along.

### 3. My own harness, not the product

The acceptance script reported a cross-tenant leak. It connects as
`shikhon_owner`, a SUPERUSER in the local container, and superusers bypass RLS
unconditionally. `db/tests/web_push.sql` had it right with `SET ROLE
shikhon_app`; the harness did not. The product was never wrong, and the fix was
one line in the harness.

## Migration 047

One table, one function. The rollback is the first in this product that **loses
data**, and says so: dropping `push_subscriptions` discards every registered
device. Nothing about a person, a child, a mark or a payment is in it, and the
browser can re-issue everything — but the consequence is silence, not an error,
because from the browser's side the subscription still exists.

Full cycle exercised: **up → 12 assertions pass → down → the suite correctly
fails (table gone) → up → 12 assertions pass**, 47/47 applied. Wired into CI in
both the main and re-run passes; `schema_lint` and the RLS-coverage gate both
pass on the new table.

## Tests

**1037 with a database attached, 755 without, all passing.** 13 DB suites green.
New in R-9:

| suite | what it holds |
|---|---|
| `packages/server-core/test/web-push.test.ts` (24) | RFC 8291 §5's vector byte for byte; `aud` is the push service ORIGIN; the signature is raw r‖s, not DER |
| `db/tests/web_push.sql` (12) | the shared device evicts the previous school; not even the principal can read an endpoint; the DEFINER function cannot be redirected |
| `services/ops-svc/test/push.test.ts` (23) | no response ever contains an endpoint; nothing inside a network survives the SSRF guard |
| `services/sms-svc/test/push-send.test.ts` (18) | a FAILED push never cancels an SMS; an emergency and a login code are never suppressed |
| `services/ops-svc/test/settings.test.ts` (13) | the endpoint's first test file, written for the bug above |
| `apps/pwa/test/push-ui.test.ts` (25) | every state renders something; the click target can only be an in-app route; `serviceWorker.ready` cannot hang the screen |

## Browser verification

- **`denied`** — the automation browser blocks notifications by policy, which
  made it the right browser to verify the hardest state in: no button, and an
  explanation of where the block actually is. A button there would call
  `requestPermission()`, get `denied` back without showing anything, and look
  like a broken app.
- **`unconfigured`** — the same screen on the deployment with no VAPID keys,
  proving the precedence: an unconfigured server outranks a denied browser, so
  nobody is sent to fix their browser for a feature the school has not enabled.
- **Mobile 375×812** — `scrollWidth === clientWidth`, no horizontal overflow.
- **The school-wide toggle** — saved as principal, **refreshed**, and both it
  and the SMS length survived. This is what caught defect 2.
- **End to end** — notice → dispatcher → VAPID header → real HTTP push service →
  decrypted to `{"title":"নথি বিদ্যালয়","body":"আগামীকাল বিদ্যালয় বন্ধ থাকবে।"}`,
  SMS row `suppressed`/`delivered_by_push`, other tenant sees 0 subscriptions.

**What could NOT be verified in a browser:** a real `pushManager.subscribe()`.
This automation browser denies notification permission by policy and blocks
service-worker registration, so the browser's own half of the handshake was
stood in for by a script that generates the same P-256 keypair, registers
through the same database function, and decrypts with the private key. That
proves our end of the contract completely and does not prove that Chrome and
Firefox accept our `applicationServerKey` — which is a first-contact risk,
recorded below rather than claimed.

## Offline classification

**Online-acceptable, deliberately.**

- **Subscribing** requires the network by definition: the browser is asking a
  push service for an endpoint.
- **The notification screen** is configuration, not a workflow a teacher must
  complete during a power cut.
- **Receiving** a push is the opposite of an offline concern — it is what
  happens when the device *has* connectivity, and it arrives whether or not the
  app is open, which is the whole point.

Nothing here touches the outbox or the sync engine, and no second offline
mechanism was created.

## Known limitations

1. **Never handshaken with a real push service.** Verified against the RFC
   vectors and a fake service; FCM, Mozilla and Apple have not seen a message
   from this code. The likeliest first-contact corrections are the
   `applicationServerKey` encoding and a 400 whose body explains nothing.
2. **A real `pushManager.subscribe()` was not exercised** — see above.
3. **No retry for a push that failed transiently.** A 500 or 503 leaves the row
   `queued` and the SMS goes out, which is the safe outcome and also means a
   momentary push outage costs the school an SMS. `failure_count` is stored and
   nothing reads it yet.
4. **`last_success_at` means a push service accepted it**, not that a person saw
   it. The same distinction R-8 drew for SMS, drawn here in the column name.
5. **No per-notice channel choice.** A school opts in for everything or nothing;
   there is no "always SMS for absences, push for the rest".
6. **iOS needs the app added to the Home Screen** before Safari will allow web
   push at all. The screen reports `unsupported` there, which is accurate, but
   it does not explain the Home Screen step.
7. **DNS rebinding is not defended against.** The SSRF guard refuses IP
   literals, non-https, credentials in the URL and internal-looking names, but a
   public hostname whose DNS answers with a private address would still be
   fetched. Defeating that needs resolve-then-connect-to-the-resolved-IP, which
   `fetch` does not offer.

## Carried backlog — preserved, none of it closed by R-9

**R-3:** class/section edit UI · guardian unlink workflow · audit export and
entity-name resolution · `POST /rms/solve` API-only by decision.

**R-5:** object storage (no stored PDFs or student photos) · CSV export
(`toCsv()` still unused) · multi-card ID-card layout · **money-formatting
decision** (still open, still needs a call).

**R-6:** an index on the board registration/roll columns · an attendance
date-range filter · type-ahead suggestions.

**R-7:** operator SSO and key rotation · trial expiry automation · per-class
group configuration in the wizard · logo/favicon/watermark upload in the wizard
· wildcard DNS/TLS · platform audit UI · plan feature gating.

**R-8:** SMS retry backoff · AI soft-limit notification wired to R-2 ·
per-message cost on send · the aggregator contract, the MFS merchant agreement,
the data-residency decision and pilot schools (all external).

**R-9 (new):** push retry/backoff · per-notice channel choice · the iOS
Home-Screen explanation · a first-contact test against a real push service.

**R-9 items NOT built, and still open:** section chat (optional per the plan) ·
content authoring workspace (F-403) · NCTB corpus ingestion (F-1301, external) ·
photo/voice submissions (F-902, external — object storage) · report trend charts
(F-1505) · native app wrappers (external) · library/transport/hostel/payroll.

## Unresolved bugs / issues

**1. `GET /api/v1/sync/pull` is built, mounted, tested — and no client ever
calls it.** Carried forward from R-8, unchanged and **not** closed: R-9 touches
nothing in the sync path. The only client-side mention remains a service-worker
routing rule declaring a caching strategy for a URL nothing requests;
`transport.ts` calls `/sync/push` and nothing else. Two honest resolutions
exist — wire the client to it, or delete it and its documentation — and R-9
chose neither.

**2. `docs/09-PRD-AUDIT.md` is stale**, as described above. Its P0 rows for
F-403, F-406, F-902 and F-1301 remain accurate; several of its P1/P2 rows have
since been closed by R-1…R-8 and it has not been updated in place.

## Next recommended step

**R-10 is not defined.** The master plan ends at R-9, whose remaining items are
either externally blocked or genuinely want a pilot school to aim at. The
highest-value code-only work left on the R-9 list is the **content authoring
workspace (F-403)**: it is the last open P0, and the reason it matters is stated
best by the audit itself — the product can teach a syllabus it has not been
given. Every consumer of content is built; the producer is not.

# 2026-08-29 · R-7 completion pass · Onboarding that actually reaches attendance

**Status: complete.** A shikhonBD operator onboards a **School** and a
**College** through the console, and each institution then runs its own core
workflow — five roles signing in and a teacher taking attendance — without a
line of SQL after the wizard starts.

R-7 was marked DONE in the entry above. It was not: the wizard built a school
correctly and the school could not then be used. This pass walked the whole
path the master plan describes, found seven defects, and closed them. Three of
the seven had been shipping since before R-7.

## What the audit found before any code was written

The R-7 entry above records two institutions onboarded through the console. One
of them, **মোহাম্মদপুর কলেজ, was stored as `stream=madrasah, level=combined`
and listed on the console as মাদ্রাসা** — a college displayed as a madrasa, on
the operator's own screen, for the whole phase.

That was not a typo. Screen 1 labelled the **stream** field "প্রতিষ্ঠানের ধরন"
— institution type — and the tenant list printed the stream in its ধরন column.
A stream is a teaching MEDIUM. So an operator asked for a type was shown a list
of mediums, and the four types the product supports — School, College, Madrasa,
School & College — could not be chosen at all. An operator had to know that
"College" is spelled `level=higher_secondary`.

It survived because **`apps/pwa/src/platform.ts` had no test file**. R-7 tested
the endpoints beneath the wizard thoroughly and the nine screens driving them
not at all.

## The seven defects

### 1. Institution type was not expressible (R-7)

The four types are already implied by `stream` + `level`, so they are **derived,
not stored** — a third column would be a second source of truth for a fact the
first two carry, and they would disagree the first time somebody changed a
level. `apps/pwa/src/institution-type.ts` holds the derivation; screen 1 now
asks for the type and constrains the medium and level to what that type can be,
so a School can no longer be built out of a madrasah medium and read back as a
madrasa. 21 tests, including a round trip over every (type, stream, level) the
wizard can produce.

### 2. One administrator, then the door closed (R-7)

Screen 7 created exactly one account and advanced. R-7.9 says an `it_admin` is
"created the same way", and a school needing both a principal and an IT admin
could not be finished — the second account required SQL.

The screen now creates accounts one at a time, suggests the role not yet made,
and lists what it has created. **The first version of that fix was itself
wrong**: the primary button created the account, set the activation code and
navigated away from the only screen that renders it, so the second code was
destroyed before anyone read it. A code is shown once and stored nowhere.
Creating now always stays, and each code sits beside the name it belongs to.

### 3. The wizard was not resumable (R-7)

R-7.15 promised it — "an operator can stop after step 4 and finish tomorrow" —
and every step does commit, so nothing was ever lost. What was missing was the
way back **in**: the wizard could only be entered by "+ নতুন প্রতিষ্ঠান", which
clears `tenantId` and starts a different school. An operator who stopped after
the academic setup had no route to the imports.

`resumeStepFor()` derives the step from the same counts the readiness checklist
shows, so the button names what is actually missing: *সেটআপ চালিয়ে যান — শিক্ষক
আমদানি*.

### 4. The import lost the file between validating and importing (R-7)

Dry run, then Import — and Import answered **"একটি CSV ফাইল বেছে নিন"**, one
click after validating that very file. `render()` rebuilds the file input, so
the commit re-read an input that no longer held anything. The validated text is
now kept, which is also what `digest` was always for: the bytes imported are
provably the bytes that were checked.

### 5. The importer rejected the columns its own screen asks for (R-7)

The student-import hint reads *"কলাম: রোল, নাম, শ্রেণি, শাখা, অভিভাবকের
মোবাইল"*. A CSV written by following that instruction was rejected with
**"ফাইলে আবশ্যক কলাম নেই: guardian_phone"** — naming a column the instruction
never mentioned. `অভিভাবকের মোবাইল` is now an accepted spelling, along with
`অভিভাবকের ফোন` and `অভিভাবকের নাম`.

### 6. A College could not take a single student (pre-existing, migration 012)

The NCTB catalogue covered **classes 1–10 and nothing above**. A college
provisioned cleanly — 2 classes, 2 sections, 7 grading bands, 6 fee heads — and
`class_subject_mappings: 0`. Since a fourth subject is required from class 9
upwards and there were no class-11/12 subjects to name, **every row of its first
student import was rejected**.

Two of the four supported types are affected: College, and the upper half of
School & College. Migration 048 seeds the higher-secondary set — the compulsory
subjects and the three groups, plus an আলিম core for madrasahs running to that
stage. It is reference data only: `provision_tenant` already selects from this
table by stream, level and group, so a college now provisions correctly with no
code change.

The codes are `H`-prefixed identifiers of ours, not claimed NCTB paper numbers.
Two reasons, and the second would have caused a bug: the subject set and group
structure are stable and stateable, the exact paper codes are not — and the
existing codes in that table are SSC papers, so a `combined` institution
provisioning classes 1–12 would receive `101 / Bangla 1st Paper` twice and
`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` would silently drop one.

### 7. No real user could save attendance (pre-existing)

The last step of the acceptance, and the worst of the seven. The attendance
route was mounted with a **hardcoded `academicYearId: 'yr-2026'`**, left over
from before there was a roster to ask. It is not a uuid, so every save a real
teacher made was rejected by sync with `invalid input syntax for type uuid` —
and `/sync/push` answers **200** with the rejection in the body, so the screen
could only render "১টি পাঠানো যায়নি" with no way to learn why.

Nobody had taken attendance as a real user in a real school until this walk.
`/academics/sections` now returns `academicYearId`, the roster caches the whole
section descriptor, and the attendance screen uses it — which also replaced the
hardcoded "৯-ক" header with the section's real name.

### And two things that were not defects

**A teacher taking attendance for a section they do not teach was refused** by
`attendance_sessions_scope`. That is the security model working: the wizard's
teacher import says section assignment happens later from the school's own
screens, and once the principal assigned the class teacher through
`#/academic`, the same save applied — `records: 2, smsQueued: 1`.

**The plan editor's refusal blanked the detail screen.** The detail view took
over the whole screen on any error, which is right for a failed LOAD and wrong
for a failed SAVE: the data is still there and the operator needs the form back.
An error now renders inline when there is content behind it.

## What else this pass added

- **Plan, cap and trial end are editable** (`POST /platform/plan`). They were
  writable exactly once, at creation, so a school that outgrew its cap needed
  SQL — and the refusal an operator sees on an over-cap import named a limit
  nothing in the console could raise. A cap below the current enrolment is
  refused, naming both numbers, because migration 045's trigger would otherwise
  leave the school permanently unable to enrol anyone with nothing on screen to
  explain it. No migration: the platform role writes inside the target tenant's
  own context, exactly as `setBranding` does.
- **Activation codes for staff.** `activation_issue_scope` has always let a
  principal issue a code for anyone in their school, and only the student roster
  offered it. So a teacher or IT admin — including the one the console had just
  created — could not be given a code through any UI. **Backend complete, UI
  absent**, and it was the account a new school needs first. The users screen
  now offers it with the roster's reveal-once card.
- **The activation door is always available.** It appeared only when OTP was
  switched off, as a fallback for the missing aggregator. But an activation code
  is how every newly onboarded school gets in, and with OTP enabled the door
  vanished — so a principal holding the code the console had just printed had no
  way to use it. That is R-7's own exit criterion, failing on any deployment
  where OTP works.
- **`platform.ts` boots only in a browser.** It called `matchMedia` and
  `getElementById` at module scope, which is why the nine screens had no tests.

## Browser acceptance — two institutions, five roles, one attendance

Both created through the console UI, both activated, no SQL after the wizard
started.

| | মনিপুর স্কুল | মোহাম্মদপুর কলেজ |
|---|---|---|
| Type | **বিদ্যালয়** (school) | **কলেজ** (college) |
| Level / medium | secondary · bangla_medium | higher_secondary · bangla_medium |
| Colour | `#1b5e20` | `#7b1fa2` |
| Head teacher | মোছাঃ রোকসানা বেগম | অধ্যক্ষ ড. শাহাদাত হোসেন |
| Classes · sections | 5 · 10 | 2 · 2 |
| Subjects | 36 | 13 |
| Students | 10 | 3 |

Five logins in মনিপুর স্কুল, each with an activation code issued through a UI:

1. **Principal** — `NSCUPSHX` from the wizard, then `PNN47VEV` reissued through
   the console's reuse path (`reused: true`, no duplicate account).
2. **IT admin** — created on screen 7 alongside the principal.
3. **Teacher** — code issued from the users screen, the surface this pass added.
4. **Student** — code issued from the roster by the principal.
5. **Guardian** — and the ward view shows **both children**, রাফিয়া and
   সাদিয়া, who shared one phone number in the CSV. The M:N guardian model
   works end to end from a spreadsheet column.

**Attendance:** the teacher marked রোল ১১ absent in নবম শ্রেণি — ক and saved.
`status: "applied"`, `records: 2`, `smsQueued: 1`. One session and two records
in মনিপুর স্কুল; **zero** in মোহাম্মদপুর কলেজ.

### Failure and recovery, walked

Student cap set to 10 deliberately. Importing 5 more students over 7 was refused
with **"student cap reached: this institution is capped at 10 students and this
would make 11"** — and **nothing partial was written**, still 7. Lowering the
cap to 3 was refused with *"সীমা 3 করা যাবে না — এই প্রতিষ্ঠানে এখনই 7 জন
শিক্ষার্থী আছে"*. Raising it to 300 succeeded and the blocked import then
completed. A bad row (class 99) was rejected with its line, roll, field and
reason while the other 7 imported — partial import, loudly.

### Cross-tenant, attempted rather than assumed

With a live Tenant A teacher session:

| Attempt | Result |
|---|---|
| `GET /platform/tenants` | 403 |
| the same **with** `PLATFORM_API_KEY` | 403 — both factors required |
| B's section by id | 404, not 403: no existence disclosure |
| B's student history by id | 404 |
| search for B's student by name | 0 results |
| `x-tenant-id: <B>` header | ignored; A's own sections returned |
| `?tid=<B>` on the app URL | session stays in A — title, classes, everything |
| sync push naming B's tenant and section | `TENANT_MISMATCH` |

## Performance

Measured, not claimed. Server work per step, from the console against a real
PostgreSQL: tenant creation ~1 s, academic provisioning **6.3 s** for a
5-class/10-section school (48 subject mappings, grading bands, fee heads,
14 ledger accounts) and ~1 s for a 2-class college, teacher import of 3 rows
~1 s, student import of 8 rows ~2 s.

**Wall-clock for a full onboarding is not honestly measurable from this run** —
it included applying a migration mid-flight and re-provisioning — so no
end-to-end figure is claimed. The step timings above are real; the master plan's
"hours, not days" is comfortably met by them, and a clean single-operator run
should be well under fifteen minutes.

## Tests

**1059 across 12 workspaces**, all passing. New: `apps/pwa/test/platform-console.test.ts`
(21 — the wizard's first test file), plus a Bangla-header regression in
`student-import.test.ts`. Eight DB suites re-run green; D11 three-way guard,
parameter-property guard and `schema_lint` all pass. Migration 048 exercised
up → down (33 → 0) → up (33), 48/48 applied.

## Known limitations

1. **The higher-secondary catalogue is a starting set, not the full NCTB
   syllabus.** Compulsory subjects and the three group cores; a school adds what
   else it teaches from its own subjects screen. The আলিম set is deliberately
   smaller still, because that group structure varies by board.
2. **`nctb_code` for those rows is ours, not the board's** — see defect 6.
3. **The student cap refusal is in English**, surfaced raw from the database
   trigger. Clear, and inconsistent with the rest of the console.
4. **The console's admin endpoint will grant a role to an existing phone
   number** and reports `reused: true`. That is the documented behaviour and it
   is how a code is reissued — but it also means typing an existing teacher's
   number while "principal" is selected quietly makes them a principal. It
   should name the person and ask.
5. **Teacher subject assignment is still per-section, by hand.** The wizard
   imports teachers and says so; a school with 40 teachers and 50 sections has a
   lot of clicking.
6. **`app.tenant_onboarding_state`'s `has_branding` measures `logoUrl`**, which
   the wizard cannot set. The checklist row is now labelled লোগো so it says what
   it measures, and resume no longer gates on it.
7. **Wildcard DNS and TLS remain unprovisioned** (carried from R-7).

## Carried backlog — preserved, none of it closed here

**R-3:** class/section edit UI · guardian unlink workflow · audit export and
entity-name resolution · `POST /rms/solve` API-only by decision.

**R-5:** object storage · CSV export (`toCsv()` still unused) · multi-card
ID-card layout · **money-formatting decision** (still open).

**R-6:** an index on the board registration/roll columns · an attendance
date-range filter · type-ahead suggestions.

**R-7 (remaining):** operator SSO and key rotation · trial expiry automation ·
per-class group configuration in the wizard · logo/favicon/watermark upload in
the wizard · wildcard DNS/TLS · platform audit UI · plan feature gating.

**R-8:** SMS retry backoff · AI soft-limit notification wired to R-2 ·
per-message cost on send · the aggregator contract, the MFS merchant agreement,
the data-residency decision and pilot schools (all external).

**R-9:** push retry/backoff · per-notice channel choice · the iOS Home-Screen
explanation · a first-contact test against a real push service.

## R-9's pilot gate — recorded, and not satisfied

**Web push was implemented on 2026-08-29, before any pilot**, and is recorded as
an **independently implemented R-9 capability**: it needs no pilot feedback to
design correctly, because it carries a message a school already sends over a
cheaper channel, with no change to who receives it or what it says.

**The R-9 pilot gate stands for the other six items** — section chat, content
authoring (F-403), NCTB corpus (F-1301), photo/voice (F-902), trend charts
(F-1505), native wrappers, and library/transport/hostel/payroll. Several are
exactly the questions a pilot answers: whether section chat is wanted and how it
must be moderated, which reports a principal actually opens, whether photo
submission earns its storage bill. Nothing in this pass changes that, and web
push remains deployed dark until an operator generates VAPID keys.

## Unresolved bugs / issues

**1. `GET /api/v1/sync/pull` is built, mounted, tested — and no client ever
calls it.** Carried unchanged from R-8 and R-9, and not closed here: this pass
touched `/sync/push` only to diagnose the attendance rejection. `transport.ts`
still calls push and nothing else.

**2. `docs/09-PRD-AUDIT.md` remains stale** (2026-08-12, pre-R-1…R-9).

## Next recommended step

**A pilot.** Every remaining R-9 item is behind that gate, R-8's open items are
contracts, and this pass has now walked the full operator path end to end
against a real database. The product's next real information comes from a
school, not from another phase.

---

# 2026-08-30 · R-8 production-readiness pass · Everything that is code

**Status: the code half is complete. The pilot half has not started, and R-8
cannot be called complete without it.**

R-8 as specified is production readiness *and* a pilot: real environments, a
real SMS aggregator, real backups, real monitoring, and three to five real
institutions with real teachers and real children. A large part of that is not
code and could not be done from this repository:

| Asked for | Why it did not happen |
|---|---|
| Production/staging environments configured | No deployment, no host credentials. Nothing in this environment can reach a Vercel, Netlify or Neon project |
| Real Bangladesh SMS provider | No aggregator contract and no credentials. Unchanged since the first R-8 pass |
| Real push delivery test | No real push service credentials and no device; the automation browser denies notifications by policy and blocks service-worker registration |
| Backup and restore, with a restore test | No production database to back up or restore |
| Monitoring and alerting | No production infrastructure to monitor |
| 3–5 pilot institutions, real users, offline pilot | Real schools, real teachers and real children cannot be recruited from a repository |

**Reporting any of those as done would be the exact failure the previous R-8
pass was written to prevent** — a readiness screen going green while nothing is
actually going out. So they are recorded as not done, and this entry covers
what genuinely was.

## What was built

### §4 — SMS safety, which is the part that mattered most

The single most valuable thing buildable here, because it guards the step
nobody has taken yet: pointing a real aggregator at a real school.

**The composer now says how big a send is.** It already restated the audience
as a sentence and showed the segments per person. What it could never say was
how many people "সব অভিভাবক" IS — so choosing between "this section" and "all
guardians" was choosing between two phrases, one of which costs a hundred times
more, with nothing on screen saying so. `POST /ops/notices?preview=1` counts
from `app.resolve_notice_audience`, the same STABLE resolver the publish path
uses, so the estimate and the send cannot disagree. No migration.

Two numbers, and the second is the surprise: on the acceptance school, "সবাই"
is **22 people and 4 SMS** — the rest have no phone on file or have not
consented. The bill is made of the smaller number.

The segment count is computed from `noticeSmsBody(...)` — the message the
sender actually transmits, trimmed to the tenant's cap and signed with the
school — not from the raw notice body, which is wrong in both directions at
once. The composer's per-person line now uses the server's figure too, because
two numbers disagreeing on one screen is worse than one arriving a moment late.

**Above 200 messages the send button is disabled** until a box stating the
actual numbers is ticked, and changing the audience revokes that
acknowledgement. Without the revoke, ticking for a section and then switching
to "everyone" would carry consent to a batch a hundred times larger — a gate
that made things worse than no gate.

▶ **The gate's first version was a dead end**, and a test caught it. The
estimate arrives asynchronously; `syncLive()` disabled the send button but only
`render()` draws the checkbox, so an operator saw a permanently disabled button
with nothing to enable it. The gate now forces a full render when it flips.

**`SMS_TEST_RECIPIENTS` is an allowlist**, checked immediately before the
provider call rather than at enqueue. The row is still written, still counted,
still visible — only the send is withheld, recorded as `suppressed` /
`not_in_test_allowlist`. A pilot can therefore run the real pipeline against
real school data and read exactly what would have gone out. Withholding does
not consume a retry attempt, so lifting the allowlist leaves the message
sendable.

### §9 — the four R-7 sharp edges

**A. An existing teacher was silently promoted.** Reusing an account rather
than creating a second one for a human is right and stays; doing it silently
was not. An operator who mistyped a digit onto an existing teacher's number,
with "principal" selected, promoted that teacher — and saw only `reused: true`
in a response the console never surfaced. It happened to me during R-7's
acceptance walk, which is how it was found. The endpoint now answers **409
`user_exists`** naming who the number belongs to and what they already are, and
the console asks. `confirmExisting: true` is the second act.

**B. The cap refusal reached operators in English**, straight from migration
045's trigger. The trigger is the invariant and is unchanged — it must fire
under concurrency and its message is right for a database log. The API stops
passing it through and answers with the numbers in Bangla, plus the fact an
operator most needs and a constraint message never gives: **nothing was
imported**.

▶ **The first version of that fix returned 500.** The trigger aborts the
transaction, so the catch block's re-read query failed too with `25P02`. The
numbers are now read *before* the import, and not parsed out of the message —
a message format is not an interface.

**C. HSC subject codes.** Migration 048's `H`-prefixed identifiers are ours,
not board paper numbers, and 048's header says so — which is a fact living in a
file nobody reads while the column goes on being called `nctb_code`.
`subject_catalogue.verified_against` has existed since migration 012 and is
**NULL on all 73 rows**: nothing has ever been checked against a circular. The
subjects API now reports `codeVerified` per subject from that column, so the
provenance travels with the data.

Finding, stated plainly: **no user-facing surface renders a subject code at
all** — not the subjects screen, not any printed document. The risk §9C names
is latent rather than live, and the field is there for when a surface does show
one.

**D. Subdomains were presented as working.** The console listed a school's
subdomain beside the install link under "both lead to the same institution",
and `*.shikhonbd.com` has never had DNS or a certificate. An operator could
reasonably have printed that on an admission slip. `WILDCARD_DNS_READY` is a
switch set only after provisioning; unset, the install link comes first and the
subdomain is marked **এখনো চালু হয়নি**. There is no way to detect this from
the product — a DNS lookup in a serverless function proves nothing about a
visitor's resolver — so an explicit switch that fails closed is the honest
mechanism.

### §10 — operational admin

`GET /platform/health` and a চলমান অবস্থা panel: SMS queue depth and the age of
the oldest queued message, sent/delivered/failed/suppressed, segments this
month, cost, the top failure codes, push devices and last push, **last login,
active users in 7 days, last attendance**. All counts and timestamps.

Deliberately **no names, no phone numbers, no student rows**. An operator
supporting a school needs to know whether its messages are going out and
whether anybody has logged in; the school's own staff have the screens that
show people. A platform operator browsing pupil records is what tenant
isolation exists to prevent, and rebuilding it here for convenience would be
perverse.

### §1/§8 — CORS

`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` was never a CSRF hole — this API authenticates
by bearer token and never by cookie, so a browser sends no ambient credential
and a hostile page has nothing to ride on. What it cost was defence in depth.
`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` narrows it, echoing the request origin with `Vary: Origin`;
**unset, behaviour is exactly what it was**, because a production control that
breaks an unconfigured deployment is one nobody turns on.

## §8 — the security review, and what it found

Run against the real database rather than read off the source.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| RLS on every tenant-scoped table | **Pass.** 12 tables lack FORCE; 10 are platform-global reference data with no `tenant_id` |
| `product_events` / `product_event_rollups` | Tenant-scoped and not FORCEd — **verified safe**. RLS is *enabled*, so the runtime role is bound; FORCE is off only so the maintenance cron's owner can aggregate. Probed directly: owner sees both tenants, `shikhon_app` sees exactly one |
| Service roles | **Pass.** Neither `shikhon_app` nor `shikhon_platform` has `BYPASSRLS` or `SUPERUSER` |
| Secrets in browser bundles | **Pass.** One hit is the string `PLATFORM_API_KEY` as a form *label*; the operator types the key and it lives in memory for the session |
| Secrets in git history | **Pass.** All 134 commits clean |
| XSS | **Pass.** `innerHTML` is used for icons from literal maps, and for the letterhead, which applies `escapeHtml()` to every interpolated value |
| CSRF | **Structurally absent.** No cookie authentication anywhere; nothing to ride on |
| SSRF | **Pass.** The push-subscription endpoint refuses non-https, URL credentials, IP literals and internal names. DNS rebinding remains undefended and is documented |
| Rate limiting | **Pass.** All 10 service dispatchers |
| Cross-tenant | **Pass.** Re-verified in R-7's acceptance: 404 not 403 for another school's rows, `x-tenant-id` ignored, `?tid=` ignored, sync push answered `TENANT_MISMATCH` |
| Platform authorization | **Pass.** A tenant token is refused 403 even when presented *with* `PLATFORM_API_KEY` — both factors required |

**Finding, recorded rather than fixed:** `SERVICE_API_KEY` is a full
cross-tenant impersonation credential on `/sync/push` and `/sync/pull` — it
permits `X-Tenant-ID` / `X-User-ID` / `X-Role` headers to be trusted. That is
the documented machine-to-machine design and the key is never in a browser, but
it is the widest tenant-scoped credential in the product and its rotation
matters more than its blast-radius note currently conveys.

## A test that was passing for the wrong reason

`db/tests/product_events.sql` claims to prove the rollup crosses tenants. It
arrived at that assertion with `app.tenant_id` still set from an earlier
fixture block — so with only one tenant's events in the window, every rollup
row matched the set tenant and **the cross-tenant path was never taken**.

It surfaced the moment a second tenant had events in the last seven days, which
is the state of any database that has been used: the R-7 acceptance logins put
telemetry in for two schools, and the suite failed with `cross-tenant insert
blocked`.

The production path was verified to be correct — the maintenance cron runs as
the owner with no tenant context, `shikhon_owner` is a member of
`shikhon_platform`, and `app.enforce_tenant` permits exactly that — so this was
a fixture fault. The context is now cleared explicitly before the rollup, and
the test exercises the production path rather than a single-tenant shadow of it.

## Tests

**1090 across 12 workspaces, all passing. 26 DB suites green.** New:

| suite | what it holds |
|---|---|
| `services/sms-svc/test/allowlist.test.ts` (7) | an unset allowlist means unrestricted, not "send to nobody"; a withheld row is recorded, not hidden; withholding costs no retry attempt |
| `services/ops-svc/test/notice-preview.test.ts` (8) | it counts who would be TEXTED, not who is in the audience; segments come from the sent message; preview **writes nothing**; a student cannot size the school's guardian list |
| `apps/pwa/test/notice-safety.test.ts` (6) | a big send cannot go without acknowledgement; the acknowledgement states the numbers; **changing the audience revokes it**; an offline estimate does not block sending |
| `packages/server-core/test/http.test.ts` (9) | unset `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` behaves exactly as before; an unlisted origin gets neither an echo nor a wildcard; credentials are never allowed |

Updated: the platform suite's reuse test now asserts the 409-then-confirm
contract, and its cap test asserts Bangla numerals and the absence of the
trigger's English.

## Browser verification

- **§9A** — the console refuses an existing number and names the person.
- **§9B** — an over-cap import answers 409 with "সীমা ১১ জন, এখন ভর্তি আছে ১০
  জন। কিছুই আমদানি হয়নি।" and the roll is unchanged at 10.
- **§9D** — the tenant detail lists the install link first and the subdomain as
  **এখনো চালু হয়নি**, with the note telling the operator which to print.
- **§4** — the composer shows "২২ জন পাবে · ৪ জনকে এসএমএস · আনুমানিক ৮টি
  এসএমএস" live as the audience and body change.
- **§10** — the চলমান অবস্থা panel shows last login ৩০ আগস্ট, 5 active users in
  7 days, last attendance ২৯ আগস্ট.

## Documentation

`docs/12-PRODUCTION-RUNBOOK.md` is new, and its **first section is a table of
what has and has not been exercised**, because every procedure in a runbook
reads identically whether it has been rehearsed or merely written down, and the
difference matters at 08:00 on a Sunday. It carries environment separation, the
domain position, the order in which to turn SMS on (allowlist first), SMS
troubleshooting, the untested backup/restore procedure with the RPO/RTO
decision still open, the absence of monitoring, a support matrix, and a pilot
checklist.

## What R-8 still needs, in the order it blocks a pilot

1. **An SMS aggregator contract.** Everything downstream of it is built and
   tested against a fake.
2. **A production deployment**, its environment variables, and its Neon
   project.
3. **A backup restored, and timed.** RPO and RTO are undecided.
4. **Cron-failure alerting.** If the dispatcher stops, no parent is told
   anything and nothing says so.
5. **Wildcard DNS and TLS**, or the acceptance that `?tid=` is the address.
6. **Three to five schools.**

## R-9's pilot gate

**Still not satisfied, and nothing in this pass changes that.** Web push
remains recorded as an independently implemented pre-pilot capability. Section
chat, content authoring, photo/voice, trend charts, native wrappers and
library/transport/hostel/payroll stay gated, and none was touched.

## Carried backlog — preserved

**R-3:** class/section edit UI · guardian unlink · audit export and entity-name
resolution · `POST /rms/solve` API-only.

**R-5:** object storage · CSV export · multi-card ID layout · **money
formatting** (still open).

**R-6:** board-registration index · attendance date-range filter · type-ahead.

**R-7:** operator SSO and key rotation · trial-expiry automation · per-class
group configuration in the wizard · logo/watermark upload in the wizard ·
platform audit UI · plan feature gating · teacher→subject assignment is still
per-section by hand.

**R-8 (new):** SMS retry backoff · monitoring and alerting · backup/restore
verification · RPO/RTO decision · `SERVICE_API_KEY` blast-radius review · a
curriculum specialist to fill `verified_against`.

**R-9:** push retry/backoff · per-notice channel choice · the iOS Home-Screen
explanation · a first-contact test against a real push service.

## Unresolved bugs / issues

**1. `GET /api/v1/sync/pull` is built, mounted, tested — and no client ever
calls it.** Carried unchanged from R-8, R-9 and the R-7 completion pass.

**2. `docs/09-PRD-AUDIT.md` remains stale** (2026-08-12).

## Next recommended step

**Sign an SMS aggregator contract and stand up one production deployment.**
Every remaining item on this list is behind one of those two, and the code that
waits on them has been built and tested as far as a fake can take it.

---

# 2026-08-30 · R-8 activation & hardening pass · The gap between configured and demonstrated

**Status: R-8 remains IN PROGRESS.** This pass closed the last of the code-side
work and built the machinery that will *record* the external work. It did not
do the external work, because none of it can be done from a repository: there
is no production deployment to configure, no aggregator contract to exercise,
no production database to restore, no device to push to, and no school to pilot
with.

What changed is that those gaps are now enforced rather than described. Before
this pass, "SMS is ready" and "an SMS reached a handset" were two claims that
looked the same in a report. Now the first is checked by a program and the
second requires a dated attestation from a person, and the preflight refuses to
call a deployment ready without both.

## The preflight (§1)

`scripts/preflight.mjs` — 32 checks over environment variables, secret strength
and distinctness, database separation and TLS, the maintenance and platform
roles, service-key posture, origins, committed bundles, the manifest and
service worker, cron ownership, SMS credentials and allowlist, VAPID keys, and
eleven external items. One line per check, with its evidence, never a value.

Three states, and the third is the point. PASS and FAIL are what a program can
decide. **UNVERIFIED** is for the things it cannot: DNS resolving, TLS
terminating, a restore performed, an SMS reaching a handset, a push landing on
a device, an alert waking a person. Those read from
`docs/production-evidence.json`, where a human records an outcome with a date,
and they lapse after 180 days.

It would have been easy to check the proxy — a key is set, a URL is configured
— and print PASS. That is the single most dishonest thing this file could have
done, and it is precisely the mistake the previous R-8 report was written to
avoid making twice.

Exit 0 all clear · 1 failed · **2 configured but never demonstrated**. This
deployment exits 1 today (6 fail, 16 unverified) and every one of those lines
is true.

## SERVICE_API_KEY (§2)

The previous report named this the widest credential in the product and left it
there. Removal was never the instruction and would have been the reckless
choice: this key is how an engineer replays a school's stuck sync batch at
11pm. So it was narrowed instead, in one place —
`packages/server-core/src/service-auth.ts` — because `/sync/push` and
`/sync/pull` held two copies of the logic and a change to one would silently
have left the other open.

1. **Off in production** unless `SERVICE_KEY_TENANT_SWITCH=on`. Dev, CI and
   staging unchanged; a control that breaks the places people actually run is a
   control that gets turned off again.
2. **Refused from a browser** — a valid key arriving with `Origin`, `Cookie` or
   `Sec-Fetch-Site` means the key has leaked into page code, and the refusal
   turns a silent leak into a dated log line. The check fires only *after* the
   token matches, so the PWA's unauthenticated system-screen probes still get
   their 401.
3. **Audited** — one structured line per acceptance and refusal, carrying an
   8-hex fingerprint, never the key.
4. **Rotatable** — `SERVICE_API_KEY_NEXT` is accepted alongside the current
   key, and the log's `keyLabel` says which slot each request matched, so a
   rotation can be finished on evidence rather than hope.
5. **Constant-time comparison.**

The same switch now gates the OTP debug echo, because echoing a live login code
is an account-takeover primitive and belongs behind the same door.

### The bug this found in its own first version

`Sec-Fetch-Mode` was in the browser-marker list. **Node's own `fetch` sends
`Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors` on every request** — and undici is what the Netlify cron
wrapper and every ops script use. Shipped, it would have refused the scheduled
SMS dispatch and the nightly maintenance job, silently, on the first production
run: the exact "a stopped cron silences a school" failure the monitoring work
in this same pass exists to catch.

It was found by running an acceptance probe against the live endpoint, not by
reading the code, and it is the strongest argument in this pass for probing
over reasoning. `Sec-Fetch-Site` covers the same browsers and undici sends
neither. There is now a test built from the exact header set undici produces.

## Monitoring (§7)

The previous report's most uncomfortable line was that a stopped cron would
silence a school with nobody noticing. `/api/v1/ops/monitor` is the answer:
scheduled every fifteen minutes, evaluating seven conditions across the whole
deployment, POSTing anything firing to `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`, and logging it
regardless so the host's log drain works as a sink from the first deploy.

The evaluation is **pure** (`packages/server-core/src/alerts.ts`) and the
gather is separate (`monitor-signals.ts`). Every threshold is a judgement call,
and judgement calls inside a database query are judgement calls nobody can
test; each is now exercised at its boundary without a database.

Note what most of the conditions watch for: not errors, but the **absence of
expected work**. A queue that stops draining. A partition that stops being
pre-created — which is a hard deadline, not a warning, because when the month
turns without one, every attendance write fails at once. Attendance that stops
landing. Loud failures look after themselves; somebody rings. The quiet ones
are invisible to anything that only counts errors.

Each alert carries its own investigation path and recovery procedure, so a
woken engineer reads what to do rather than remembering it. `sync_rejection_rate`
names the R-7 defect it exists to catch, because the lesson of that bug — the
client was sending something the server would not take, and the only symptom a
teacher saw was "১টি পাঠানো যায়নি" — is worth more than the threshold.

**What it cannot see:** API failure rate. There is no table of HTTP responses
and inventing one would duplicate what the host already records per invocation;
that alert belongs in the host's metric alerting, wired as the runbook
describes. And its own death — a dead function does not report it, so the
host's scheduled-function failure notification is part of the monitor.

### A second bug caught by reading it back

The gather bounded the SMS queue query to the last two partitions, for
performance. That would have excluded a message stuck since last week —
precisely the case `sms_queue_stalled` exists to raise — while leaving the
check looking like it worked. Split into two queries: recent activity stays
bounded, the queue is not bounded at all.

## The last two R-7 sharp edges

**§9A** already refused an existing phone number and named the person and their
current role. What it never named was the **consequence**, and "are you sure?"
without a stated outcome is how an operator clicks through. It now says, in
words: নিশ্চিত করলে এই অ্যাকাউন্টের ভূমিকা প্রধান শিক্ষক করা হবে। Not shown when
the account already holds the role, because a screen that cries wolf on the
harmless case is not read on the dangerous one.

**§11** The HSC catalogue is shikhonBD's own reference set with codes we
assigned — the `H-` prefix exists so they cannot be mistaken for board numbers
and cannot collide with SSC codes in a combined institution. The console now
says so at the moment classes 11–12 are seeded, before a registrar assumes the
list was checked against a circular and builds a year on it.

Both verified in a real browser, and both now held by DOM tests — which
required exporting the console class. That file's own header records that it
had no test file at all until R-7's completion pass, which is how a college
spent a phase being listed as a madrasa.

## CORS (§3)

`/sync/push` and `/sync/pull` still carried hardcoded `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
after the previous pass routed everything else through the allowlist. Both now
use it. **Verified in Chrome:** with `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` set, a listed origin
receives the response and an unlisted one is blocked by the browser;
credentialed requests are refused; `Vary: Origin` is present so a shared cache
cannot serve one origin's response to another.

## Verification

- **1108 tests** with a database attached (1090 before this pass), **838**
  without. All passing.
- The monitor's gather **run against the real schema** — every column, the
  partition catalogue query, and the alert it produced from real rows.
- Alert delivery **proven end to end**: `GET` delivers nothing, `POST` produces
  exactly one webhook call with the right URL, method and content type,
  carrying the alert text, the environment and the recovery guidance and no
  secrets. A dead sink returns 200 with the reason, rather than taking the
  endpoint down with it.
- **Cross-tenant probes against the live sync endpoints**: a real teacher's
  token plus forged `X-Tenant-ID` / `X-User-ID` / `X-Role` returns that
  teacher's own school, byte for byte, with no row of the other tenant present.
  Headers without a token: 401. Garbage bearer with headers: 401.
- Browser acceptance of §9A, §11 and the CORS allowlist.

## What is still not done, and cannot be from here

Real SMS delivery · real push to a device · backups and a timed restore ·
an alert reaching a human · wildcard DNS and TLS · 3–5 pilot institutions ·
real users · a real offline test · cross-tenant tests against production.

Every one of these now has a named slot in `docs/production-evidence.json` that
is **null**, a preflight line that reports it as unverified, and a procedure in
the runbook. None of them is claimed anywhere.

## R-9's pilot gate

**Still not satisfied, and deliberately so.** No pilot has occurred. The web
push implementation recorded on 2026-08-29 remains an independently implemented
R-9 capability that did not require pilot feedback; the gate on the remaining
R-9 optional capabilities is untouched by this pass and stays shut.


## Carried backlog — preserved

**R-3:** class/section edit UI · guardian unlink · audit export and entity-name
resolution · `POST /rms/solve` API-only.

**R-5:** object storage · CSV export · multi-card ID layout · **money
formatting** (still open).

**R-6:** board-registration index · attendance date-range filter · type-ahead.

**R-7:** operator SSO and key rotation · trial-expiry automation · per-class
group configuration in the wizard · logo/watermark upload in the wizard ·
platform audit UI · plan feature gating · teacher→subject assignment is still
per-section by hand.

**R-8:** SMS retry backoff · backup/restore verification · RPO/RTO decision ·
a curriculum specialist to fill `verified_against` · per-institution subject
configuration for colleges beyond add and remove · API failure-rate alerting
in the host's own metrics · the host's scheduled-function failure notification.

*Closed by this pass: monitoring and alerting is built, scheduled and tested —
what remains is delivering one alert to a human, which is an attestation rather
than code. The `SERVICE_API_KEY` blast-radius review is done, and the key is
narrowed, audited and rotatable.*

**R-9:** push retry/backoff · per-notice channel choice · the iOS Home-Screen
explanation · a first-contact test against a real push service.

## Unresolved bugs / issues

**1. `GET /api/v1/sync/pull` is built, mounted, tested — and no client ever
calls it.** Carried unchanged from R-8, R-9, the R-7 completion pass and the
R-8 production-readiness pass.

**2. `docs/09-PRD-AUDIT.md` remains stale** (2026-08-12).

## Next recommended step

**Sign an SMS aggregator contract and stand up one production deployment**, in
that order. Everything left on this list is behind one of those two, and the
first thing to do on the deployment is run `node scripts/preflight.mjs` and
work the failures down — it is written to be the first command of that day.

---

# 2026-08-30 · R-8 production closure pass · Evidence that cannot be faked

**Status: R-8 remains OPEN.** Every external gate is still shut, and this entry
exists to record what was built to close them and what was actually observed —
not to move the status.

The instruction for this pass listed fifteen sections. Ten of them require a
production deployment, an aggregator contract, a domain, a real device or a
real school, and none of those exists. Rather than write ten paragraphs saying
so, the pass did the five that are real work and built the mechanism that makes
the other ten impossible to fake.

## The mechanism (§1, §13)

`scripts/preflight.mjs` checks configuration. `docs/production-evidence.json`
records observation. Neither can green the other's half.

The load-bearing part is the **environment field**. An attestation now names
the deployment it was made against, and the preflight compares that to the
deployment being checked. So this pass's restore drill — genuinely executed,
genuinely passing — reports as:

```
[ ?? ] a restore was performed and verified
       attested 2026-08-30 against "local-docker", NOT "production"
       — a rehearsal elsewhere, not evidence for this deployment
```

That line is the whole design. A rehearsal is real work and worth recording,
and it is not a production restore, and an evidence file that could not tell
those apart would let the first close the second.

## The restore drill (§5, marked highest priority)

`scripts/restore-drill.mjs`: back up, restore into an **isolated** database
(refusing outright if the target is the source), then compare the copy against
the original — every schema object count, every table count, and every tenant's
students, teachers, guardians, attendance, marks and invoices. Any difference
fails, and it names which.

The comparison is the point. "The restore completed" is not evidence:
`pg_restore` exits 0 having skipped objects it could not create, a dump taken
with the wrong flags restores a schema with no rows in it, and a partitioned
table can come back with its parent and none of its children. Every one of
those looks like success and has lost a school's attendance.

**Observed, local Docker, Postgres 16.15:** 2.6 MB dumped in 0.6s, restored in
3.0s. 121 tables, 355 indexes, 110 RLS-enabled tables, 227 policies, 86
functions, 162 triggers, 4 attendance partitions, 27 table counts and 8 tenants
— all identical. **RTO 4.0s**, on 2.6 MB, which is not a school year.

**RPO is not measured**, here or anywhere. It is a property of the backup
SCHEDULE, and a drill claiming to measure it would be measuring nothing.

### The drill caught a defect in its own comparison

It matched tenants **by display name**, and two schools on this database are
both called মোহাম্মদপুর কলেজ — so one was compared against itself and a phantom
mismatch reported. Two real schools sharing a name is ordinary in Bangladesh,
not a corner case. Keyed by id now.

## The live security probe (§12)

`scripts/security-probe.mjs` — committed rather than thrown away, because the
point of it is to be re-run: on staging, on production, after a policy change,
before a pilot. It discovers its own fixtures from whatever database it is
given, so the identical battery runs anywhere.

**29 checks over 12 areas, positive and negative, all passing.** Positive cases
are not filler: every negative here would also pass on a deployment where the
database is unreachable and everything 500s, and a report that cannot tell
"tenant B did not leak" from "nothing works" is worthless.

Covered: forged `X-Tenant-ID`/`X-User-ID`/`X-Role` ignored in favour of signed
claims; headers-without-token and garbage-bearer both 401; cross-tenant reads
of section, student and attendance by id refused; **a cross-tenant WRITE
through a payload `tenantId` not applied**; no runtime role holds SUPERUSER or
BYPASSRLS; tenant A's database context cannot see tenant B's rows by primary
key **while still seeing its own**; no tenant context means nothing visible;
every table carrying `tenant_id` has RLS enabled; a service credential from a
browser refused; a user token is not a service credential and cannot run
maintenance; 7 SSRF vectors (http, loopback, 169.254.169.254, private range,
userinfo, `.internal`, `.local`) all refused; cross-tenant notice and document
access refused; the platform health endpoint unreachable with a tenant token;
the console refuses both a tenant user and an anonymous caller; no live secret
or connection string in any bundle; error bodies carry no credential; an
unlisted CORS origin is not echoed and credentials are never allowed;
per-phone OTP requests are rate-limited.

**A third state had to be added.** The OTP check first reported FAIL, and the
cause was the fixture: OTP is disabled on that deployment and the feature gate
answers before the limiter, so the check could not run. Reporting that as PASS
would have been the exact dishonesty this pass exists to stamp out; reporting
it as FAIL trains a reader to ignore failures. It is SKIP, it says why, and the
summary counts it separately. Re-run against a deployment with
`OTP_SENDING_ENABLED` set: **29/29, nothing skipped.**

## Onboarding, measured rather than asserted (§11)

The master plan carries an "onboarded in under one hour" target and R-8 forbids
claiming it unmeasured. `audit.platform_access` already timestamps every
console action, so the duration is **derived** — no new column, and nothing for
an operator to remember to set. A crashed halfway onboarding leaves the audit
rows exactly right where a `finished_at` column would be wrong forever.

Surfaced two ways, per D13: on the school's own page in the console
(সেটআপে লেগেছে ১ ঘণ্টা ১ মিনিট · সেটআপের ধাপ ৭টি) and aggregated by
`scripts/pilot-report.mjs`.

### Three ways it could have flattered itself, all closed

1. The report summarised **every** tenant and duly announced "measured
   onboardings: 2, median 61 min" — both of them the author's own walks through
   the wizard, one automated. Nothing counts now unless it is named in
   `PILOT_TENANT_IDS`. Designating a pilot is a deliberate act, and that is
   what makes the number mean anything.
2. A seeded tenant rendered as **"০ মিনিট"** — the prettiest lie available on
   that screen, and precisely the number somebody would later quote as evidence
   for the target. The server computes `synthetic` and the console says
   স্বয়ংক্রিয়ভাবে তৈরি — সময় গণনার যোগ্য নয়.
3. A single-step onboarding reports **null**, not zero. Zero averages
   beautifully and means nothing.

### And one plain bug

A principal who signs in while the operator is still importing students
produces a negative interval — which is normal, and a good sign. The console
printed **"-১৭ মিনিট পরে"**. Found by opening the one school that was onboarded
by hand. It says সেটআপ চলাকালীনই now, and the signedness is documented at the
source rather than clamped away.

## Settings (§8, fourth edge)

Written, re-read through a fresh request, confirmed directly in the database,
and tenant B left untouched by A's write through **body `tenantId`, an
`X-Tenant-ID` header and a `?tenantId=` query** — all three answered 200 for A's
own school and touched nothing of B's.

## Host metrics (§7)

Deliberately not rebuilt inside the product: the host already records every
invocation, and a table of HTTP responses here would duplicate a source of
truth and be wrong in a different way from it. §6 of the runbook now names
where each metric lives, its threshold, who is told, and how to investigate —
with two rules: the destination must be the same one `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` points
at, and the scheduled-function failure notification must be on before the first
pilot, because it is the only thing that can report the monitor's own death.

## Verification

- **1160 tests** with a database attached, **890** without. All passing.
- 26 DB suites green, 48/48 migrations applied.
- `check-secrets --history` clean across every commit.
- D11 three-way brand guard and the parameter-property guard passing.
- Browser: the onboarding row on the console health panel, both the real
  61-minute run and the synthetic case.

### One process mistake, recorded

The pilot runbook already existed — 371 lines of manual SQL fallback from R-7 —
and the first version of this pass **overwrote it**, deleting 313 lines to
write a fresh one. That is precisely the erasure the phase instructions forbid,
and it was caught by reading `git diff --stat` before the commit rather than by
any guard. Restored, and the new material (§13–18: pilot selection, the
evidence tables, the HSC conversation, the offline test, blockers) is appended.
The diff is now 140 insertions and no deletions.

## The gates, and none of them moved

| Gate | State |
|---|---|
| Production deployment | **shut** — none exists |
| DNS / TLS | **shut** — no domain control |
| Real SMS | **shut** — no aggregator contract |
| Real push | **shut** — no device has ever been called |
| Backup restore | **rehearsed on local-docker**, production shut |
| Monitoring human alert | **shut** — no sink configured |
| Security final pass | **rehearsed on local-docker**, 29/29 |
| R-7 onboarding in production | **shut** |
| 3–5 pilot institutions | **shut** — zero |
| Real user core workflows | **shut** |
| Offline real-world test | **shut** |

## R-9's pilot gate

**Unsatisfied.** No pilot has occurred. The web push implementation recorded on
2026-08-29 remains an independently implemented R-9 capability that did not
require pilot feedback; the gate on the remaining six R-9 items is untouched by
this pass and stays shut. No R-9 optional feature was implemented.

## Carried backlog — preserved

**R-3:** class/section edit UI · guardian unlink · audit export and entity-name
resolution · `POST /rms/solve` API-only.

**R-5:** object storage · CSV export · multi-card ID layout · **money
formatting** (still open).

**R-6:** board-registration index · attendance date-range filter · type-ahead.

**R-7:** operator SSO and key rotation · trial-expiry automation · per-class
group configuration in the wizard · logo/watermark upload in the wizard ·
platform audit UI · plan feature gating · teacher→subject assignment is still
per-section by hand.

**R-8:** SMS retry backoff · RPO/RTO **decision** (the drill measures RTO; the
numbers are still a policy call) · a curriculum specialist to fill
`verified_against` · per-institution subject configuration for colleges beyond
add and remove · API failure-rate alerting in the host's own metrics · the
host's scheduled-function failure notification · a production restore drill.

*Closed by this pass: the restore drill itself, the live security probe, the
production preflight, and onboarding measurement.*

**R-9:** push retry/backoff · per-notice channel choice · the iOS Home-Screen
explanation · a first-contact test against a real push service.

## Unresolved bugs / issues

**1. `GET /api/v1/sync/pull` is built, mounted, tested — and no client ever
calls it.** Carried unchanged since R-8's first pass.

**2. `docs/09-PRD-AUDIT.md` remains stale** (2026-08-12).

## Next recommended step

Unchanged and now unambiguous: **sign an SMS aggregator contract and stand up
one production deployment.** On the day the deployment exists, the first three
commands are `node scripts/preflight.mjs`, then `scripts/restore-drill.mjs` and
`scripts/security-probe.mjs` against it — all three written during this pass
precisely so that day is a repeat of something rehearsed rather than a first
attempt.

# 2026-08-30 · R-8 external readiness pass · Eight gates, one attempted, none closed

**Status: R-8 remains OPEN.** Nothing in this entry moves a gate. It records
what was attempted, what was learned, and — for the one gate that was
genuinely reachable — exactly what stopped it.

The eight priorities in this pass are all *external*. Seven of them need a
credential, a contract, a domain or an institution that does not exist and
cannot be brought into existence from a repository. Writing seven paragraphs
saying "blocked" would be padding, so the pass did the only useful thing
available: it **attempted the one gate that might have been reachable**, and
turned an assumption into a dated finding.

## Real web push (§5) — attempted, blocked, and now evidenced

Previous entries said push was unverified. That was an assumption about the
environment rather than an observation, and it was worth testing rather than
repeating.

**What worked, and it is more than expected:**

- Real VAPID keys generated — P-256, 87-character public key.
- **Network egress to real push services confirmed.** `fcm.googleapis.com`
  answered HTTP 400 and `updates.push.services.mozilla.com` answered 406 —
  real HTTP responses from the real services, not connection failures. The
  path from this machine to Google's and Mozilla's push infrastructure is
  open.
- The app served over a secure context (127.0.0.1 counts), with
  `PushManager`, `ServiceWorker` and `Notification` all present.

**What blocked it, in the automated browser available here:**

1. `Notification.permission` was already `"denied"`, and
   `requestPermission()` returned `"denied"` **without prompting**. No user
   gesture can lift that from JavaScript, and
   `pushManager.subscribe({userVisibleOnly: true})` cannot be reached without
   it.
2. `navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')` fails with *"An unknown error
   occurred when fetching the script"* — while the page itself fetches that
   exact URL with **HTTP 200, `content-type: text/javascript`, 5551 bytes, and
   it parses as valid JavaScript**. That distinction matters and is why it was
   checked: the failure is the browser profile disabling service workers, and
   **not a defect in the product**.
3. `list_connected_browsers` returned empty — no real Chrome is reachable, so
   no real device could be substituted.

**Conclusion.** Everything on our side of the boundary is in place: keys,
encryption, subscription endpoint, sender, fallback. Only the device is
missing. Closing this gate needs an ordinary Chrome, Edge or Firefox on a real
machine, where a person can click Allow, pointed at a deployment carrying the
VAPID keys. It is a ten-minute task for someone with a browser and impossible
for someone without one.

## Real offline connectivity (§6) — blocked by the same finding

The instruction was explicit: do not use "server stopped" as the final proof.
The better test — a real connectivity loss with the service worker serving the
shell — depends on the service worker registering, which is exactly what fails
above. So no improvement over the existing evidence was possible, and none is
claimed. The procedure remains written out in
[12-PRODUCTION-RUNBOOK.md](12-PRODUCTION-RUNBOOK.md) §8a.

## The other six gates

Deployment, real SMS, a human alert destination, production backup and restore,
pilot institutions and pilot stabilisation. Each needs something this
environment does not contain and cannot create — host credentials, a signed
aggregator contract, an alerting workspace, a production database, and schools.
No work was invented to look busy against them, and per §13 no new architecture
was introduced.

## One schema addition, and its reasoning

`docs/production-evidence.json` gains a third status, `"blocked"`: attempted,
could not be completed, obstacle recorded, **`result` stays null** so it closes
nothing. The preflight reports it as unverified and prints the obstacle.

A bare null says "unknown". After this pass, real push is not unknown — we know
precisely what stopped it, and that is worth more to whoever picks this up than
an empty field. It also stops the same dead end being walked into twice.

## Verification

No product code changed in this pass. The suite stands where the closure pass
left it: **1158 tests** with a database, **862** without, 26 DB suites, 48/48
migrations. `node scripts/preflight.mjs` against a `production` environment
reports **10 pass · 7 fail · 15 unverified**, and refuses.

## The gates, unchanged

| Gate | State |
|---|---|
| Production deployed | **shut** — no host credentials exist |
| DNS / TLS verified | **shut** — no domain control |
| Real SMS delivered | **shut** — no aggregator contract |
| Human monitoring alert received | **shut** — no sink configured |
| Backup restore verified | **shut** in production; rehearsed on local-docker |
| Real push delivered | **shut — attempted 2026-08-30**, blocked by the browser profile; evidence recorded |
| Real offline connectivity tested | **shut** — depends on the same service worker |
| 3–5 real pilot institutions | **shut** — zero |
| Real users completed core flows | **shut** |
| Critical pilot bugs fixed | **n/a** — no pilot |
| Security re-test passed | **shut** in production; 29/29 on local-docker |
| Production evidence recorded | **partial** — 2 rehearsed, 1 blocked, 8 null |

## Known issues, carried and NOT removed  (§12)

1. **DNS/TLS not live.**
2. **Real SMS not tested.**
3. **Real push not tested** — now with a recorded reason rather than a null.
4. **Human monitoring alert not tested.**
5. **Production backup/restore not tested.**
6. **Real offline connectivity test not done.**
7. **Pilot count = 0.**
8. **`GET /api/v1/sync/pull` is built, mounted, tested — and no client ever
   calls it.** Carried since R-8's first pass.
9. `docs/09-PRD-AUDIT.md` remains stale (2026-08-12).

## R-9's pilot gate

**Closed.** No pilot has occurred and none can be arranged from here. No R-9
optional feature was implemented in this pass.

## Next recommended step

Unchanged, and now with the cheapest item first:

1. **Open the app in an ordinary browser on any real machine** with the VAPID
   keys set, click Allow, and publish a notice. That closes the push gate in
   ten minutes and needs nothing bought or signed.
2. **Sign an SMS aggregator contract.**
3. **Stand up one production deployment.** On that day, in order:
   `scripts/preflight.mjs`, `scripts/restore-drill.mjs`,
   `scripts/security-probe.mjs`.

# 2026-08-30 · R-8 enters external-dependency mode · No code, one checklist

**Status: R-8 remains OPEN**, and from this entry onward that is a *correct*
state rather than an unfinished one.

The repository-side work is accepted and closed. Everything that remains needs
something from outside the repository: a hosting account, a domain, a signed
aggregator contract, an alerting destination, a production database, a browser
with a person in front of it, and three to five schools. None of those can be
manufactured here, and the explicit rule for this mode is that **no substitute
may be built to make a gate green**.

So this pass wrote no code. It added one thing.

## The external readiness checklist (12-PRODUCTION-RUNBOOK.md §0a)

Eight groups — Production, DNS/TLS, SMS, Push, Backup, Monitoring, Offline,
Pilot — with every box unticked, and against each: what the box actually means,
which key in `docs/production-evidence.json` records it, and what would make it
tickable.

Three properties it was written to have:

1. **A box is ticked from direct observation only.** Not from configuration. A
   configured provider is not a delivered message, and that gap is the entire
   reason the evidence file exists.
2. **Every box names its evidence key**, so ticking one and forgetting to
   record it is visibly incomplete rather than silently lost.
3. **It says which gate is cheapest.** Push needs no contract, no purchase and
   no deployment — one ordinary browser and one click. Everything else waits on
   a signature or a host.

The checklist ends with the rule that governs it: a fake aggregator, a stub
push service and a local restore are all useful for exercising code, and not
one of them is evidence. R-8 may stay OPEN for as long as the prerequisites are
genuinely unavailable.

## Evidence file — unchanged, deliberately

`real_push_delivery` keeps its dated `blocked` entry from earlier today. It is
not upgraded, not softened, and not re-attempted: nothing about this
environment changed, so re-running it would produce the same result and a
second identical record. It moves to `pass` when a real browser on a real
machine completes the sequence in §4, and not before.

Current state of the eleven external items: **2 rehearsed** (restore drill,
security probe — both `local-docker`, neither closing a production gate),
**1 blocked** (real push), **8 null**.

## Known issues — carried, none removed

1. DNS/TLS not live.
2. Real SMS not tested.
3. Real push not tested — dated `blocked` evidence, reason recorded.
4. Human monitoring alert not tested.
5. Production backup/restore not tested.
6. Real offline connectivity test not done.
7. Pilot count = 0.
8. `GET /api/v1/sync/pull` is built, mounted, tested — and no client ever calls
   it. Carried since R-8's first pass.
9. `docs/09-PRD-AUDIT.md` remains stale (2026-08-12).

## R-9

**Not started. Its pilot gate stays closed.** No remaining R-9 optional
capability was implemented, and none will be until pilot stability is
demonstrated.

## What happens next, and it is not code

Nothing in this repository is waiting on this repository. The next commit
should be triggered by an external dependency arriving — an aggregator
credential, a deployment, a device — and should be the concrete integration fix
that dependency requires, verified against the real environment, followed by an
evidence-file update.

In order of cost:

1. **One browser, one click** — closes the push gate. §4 has the sequence.
2. **An SMS aggregator contract.**
3. **One production deployment.** On that day: `scripts/preflight.mjs`, then
   `scripts/restore-drill.mjs`, then `scripts/security-probe.mjs`, against it.

# 2026-08-30 · R-8 repository-only cleanup audit · A gate that had been red for six commits

**Status: R-8 remains OPEN.** No external gate moved and none was touched. This
was an audit of what can be fixed without leaving the repository, and it found
more than expected.

## The finding that matters: `tsc` had been failing since R-9

The test suite runs under `node --test`, which **strips** TypeScript rather than
checking it. So `node scripts/test-all.mjs` went green while
`npx tsc --noEmit` — the gate `.github/workflows/security.yml` actually runs —
had been failing since the R-9 web push commit. Six commits, three of them R-8
passes that each ended with a confident quality report.

Traced by checking out HEAD~6, ~8, ~10: **0 errors at R-3, 2 from R-9 onward**,
and 8 more added by my own closure pass. Ten in total across three tsconfigs.

This is the second time in R-8 that a green suite has concealed something —
the first was `product_events.sql` passing for the wrong reason. The lesson is
the same one and it is worth writing down: **a check that cannot fail is not a
check**, and the way to find out which kind you have is to break it on purpose
or, failing that, to run the one nobody has run lately.

### Three of the ten were real defects, not type noise

1. **`login-view.ts` — a stale error message on the activation screen.** The
   handler did `this.error = ''`, and `LoginView` has no `error` field; it
   clears messages by hiding `errorEl`. So a person who mistyped their phone
   number, gave up and clicked "সক্রিয়ন কোড দিয়ে প্রবেশ করুন" carried the
   phone-number error onto the code screen, where it was both wrong and
   alarming. Introduced by R-7's completion pass, which added that button.

2. **`demo.ts` — three sections with no `academicYearId`.** Required since R-7
   fixed the real version of this bug, where a hardcoded non-uuid year meant
   every attendance save was rejected and a teacher saw only "১টি পাঠানো যায়নি".
   The demo carried the same shape of defect, so a `?demo=1` visitor taking
   attendance would have hit the same wall.

3. **`harness.ts` — `CallOptions.method` had no `DELETE`.** R-9's `/ops/push`
   supports it (a person giving up a device) and the harness type was never
   widened, so `push.test.ts` could not compile even though it ran.

The other seven were `push-client.ts` reaching `Notification` through an
injected `Window` (the DOM lib declares it globally but not on the interface),
`sw.ts` setting `renotify: false` (a real platform option the lib does not
declare — now omitted, since `false` IS the default, with a note that setting
it `true` without a `tag` is a spec TypeError that would throw invisibly inside
the service worker), and my own over-tight `Queryable` type in
`onboarding-metrics.ts`, which demanded pg's entire overload set when all it
needs is *send text and values, get rows back*.

**All three tsconfigs are now at zero for the first time since R-9.**

## An unpinned third-party script on the platform's own origin

`apps/pwa/public/index.html` and `design.html` loaded
`https://unpkg.com/lucide@latest` — **unpinned**, so whatever that path serves
executes on shikhonBD's own domain, and its contents can change without any
commit here.

It never touched a school's application, so no student data was ever exposed to
it. What it did expose is the platform's shopfront, which is a credible
phishing surface. Now pinned to `lucide@1.37.0` with a SHA-384 integrity hash
and `crossorigin`/`referrerpolicy`: if unpkg ever serves different bytes the
browser refuses to run them and the icons simply do not draw, which is the
correct failure for a decorative dependency. Verified in a browser — 92 icons
render, no placeholders left.

## The README said "Built and deployed" seven times

It is not deployed. There is no production environment, and every R-8 report
has said so — while the most-read file in the repository claimed the opposite
about seven services.

**And checking that claim turned up something nobody had recorded: a public
deployment exists at `shikhon-lms.vercel.app` and answers 200.** It is a
**stale revision** — `/` serves a build predating R-1-A's three surfaces,
`/app` and `/platform` both 404, and of the API only a couple of functions
exist (`/api/v1/ops/*` is not among them). It is not the current system.

Corrected in the README with a note above the table. **The deployment itself
was not touched**: taking down or redeploying a live public site is an
outward-facing act and needs the owner's decision, not mine. It is recorded
here and in the known-issues list as something to resolve deliberately.

## Money: three formatters, one decision, three answers

Carried as "money formatting (still open)" since R-5. What was actually open:

- `packages/ui-core/src/format.ts` → `formatBdt()` — **Latin** digits,
  `en-US` grouping, used by the printed receipts and report cards.
- `apps/pwa/src/fees-view.ts` → a private `money()` — **Bangla** digits.
- `apps/pwa/src/ledger-view.ts` → a private `taka()` — **Bangla** digits, on
  the double-entry ledger an accounts clerk reconciles against a bank
  statement.

Plus three call sites rendering `৳ ${bnNum(...)}` by hand. So a parent read
**৳ ১,২৫০** on the fees screen and **৳ 1,250.00** on the receipt printed for
the same invoice.

`formatBdt`'s own comment already contained the decision — *"a fee amount in
Bangla digits is a support ticket"* — it simply was not being followed. Now
there is one formatter, and two choices are stated where it lives:

- **Latin digits**, because money must be checkable against a bank slip, an MFS
  statement and a paper ledger, none of which are in Bangla digits.
- **`en-IN` grouping**, changed from `en-US`. Bangladesh reads in lakh and
  crore: ১,২৫,০০০, not 125,000. Below a lakh the two are identical, which is
  why every existing expectation still held and why the new test for the lakh
  case is the only one that could have caught it.

Browser-verified on the fees screen: `৳ 1,250.00`, matching the receipt.

## Classified but NOT implemented

Every remaining backlog item is a **new product feature**, which this pass was
explicitly forbidden to add:

| Item | Class | Why not now |
|---|---|---|
| Class/section edit UI (R-3) | SHOULD FIX BEFORE PILOT | `structure.ts` has GET and POST only. A typo'd section name needs SQL to fix, and the pilot runbook calls that a blocker. But it is backend + API + UI + tests — a feature, needing approval |
| Guardian unlink (R-3) | SHOULD FIX BEFORE PILOT | `guardians.ts` has no DELETE. Same reasoning |
| Audit export / name resolution (R-3) | NICE TO HAVE | Feature |
| Object storage (R-5) | DEFER UNTIL AFTER PILOT | Documents render and print without it |
| CSV export (R-5) | NICE TO HAVE | Feature |
| Multi-card ID layout (R-5) | NICE TO HAVE | Cosmetic |
| Attendance date-range filter (R-6) | NICE TO HAVE | Feature |
| Board-registration index (R-6) | DEFER UNTIL AFTER PILOT | Confirmed a **seq scan** today. At pilot size (3–5 schools) that is genuinely fine, and every index costs write throughput on the student import — the biggest write in the product. The pilot produces the numbers that should decide it |
| `GET /sync/pull` unused | **NOT A BUG — reclassified** | Built, mounted, tested and working; no client calls it. That is an unused capability, not a defect. Deleting it discards working tested code; wiring it up is a feature. It stays, and it stops being listed as a bug |

## Verification

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Tests (with database) | **1160**, all passing (1158 before) |
| Tests (no database) | 862 → 864 |
| DB/RLS suites | 26/26 |
| TypeScript ×3 | **0 / 0 / 0** — was 10 / 6 / 1 |
| Migrations | 48/48 |
| D11 three-way brand guard | pass |
| Parameter-property guard | pass |
| `check-secrets --history` | clean, 136 commits |
| Security probe | **29/29**, 12 areas, positive and negative |
| Browser | pinned CDN renders 92 icons; fees screen shows `৳ 1,250.00` |

## Security re-audit

Re-run against the running deployment after every change above: tenant
isolation by header, id, query and body; a cross-tenant **write** refused; RLS
verified at the database with no runtime role holding SUPERUSER or BYPASSRLS;
role boundaries and guardian/student scoping already covered by
`guardian_links.sql`, `ward.test.ts`, `student-search.test.ts` and
`documents.sql` (three independent assertions that a guardian cannot open
another family's child); 7 SSRF vectors refused; no secret in any bundle; CORS;
per-phone OTP limiting. **No new vulnerabilities.** The one genuine security
improvement this pass is the pinned CDN script.

## Known issues — carried, plus one new

1. DNS/TLS not live.
2. Real SMS not tested.
3. Real push not tested — dated `blocked` evidence.
4. Human monitoring alert not tested.
5. Production backup/restore not tested.
6. Real offline connectivity test not done.
7. Pilot count = 0.
8. **NEW — a stale public deployment at `shikhon-lms.vercel.app`** serving a
   pre-R-1-A revision. Not touched; needs an owner decision to redeploy or
   remove.
9. `docs/09-PRD-AUDIT.md` remains stale (2026-08-12).

*Removed from this list:* `GET /sync/pull`, which was never a bug — see the
classification table above.

## R-9

**Not started. Pilot gate closed.** No R-9 optional capability implemented.

## Next external dependency required

Unchanged and unaffected by this pass: **one ordinary browser on a real machine
to close the push gate**, then an SMS aggregator contract, then a production
deployment.

---

# 2026-08-30 · Final audit preparation · The specification, not the audit

**Status: R-8 remains OPEN**, external-dependency mode unchanged. No code was
touched, no configuration changed, no evidence generated.

One deliverable: [FINAL-FULL-PROJECT-AUDIT-PLAN.md](FINAL-FULL-PROJECT-AUDIT-PLAN.md),
the permanent specification for the independent final audit that happens only
after R-8 closes, production is real, and the pilot is complete and stable.

## What it is for

An auditor who has never seen this project, with no access to any prior
conversation, should be able to read that one file and audit shikhonBD end to
end. That constraint drove every choice in it: no phrase like "as discussed",
no reliance on memory, and real names throughout — actual table names, actual
role codes read from the database, actual script paths, actual endpoint
families.

## What is in it

The fifteen sections asked for: audit philosophy · full system scope (30 areas)
· a 35-row security attack matrix · a role matrix across six roles · a tenant
isolation matrix over fourteen resources in both directions · a D13 UI/UX pass
· offline · data integrity · performance · production readiness · documentation
contradiction hunting · severity definitions · the four-pass process · the
evidence rule · the release decision with a checklist and sign-off.

Plus two appendices that are the part I would most want if I were the auditor.

## Appendix A — the traps

Twelve things that have already produced a wrong answer in this project,
written down so the next person does not rediscover them at their own cost:
`SET LOCAL` discarded outside a transaction; a bare pool query seeing nothing
under RLS; **superusers bypassing RLS**, which produced a false cross-tenant
leak in an early harness; `node --test` stripping types rather than checking
them; `jsonb_set` as a silent no-op; `ON CONFLICT` and NULL distinctness; a
trigger aborting the transaction its catch block then queries; `/sync/push`
returning 200 with the rejection inside the body; Node's `fetch` sending
`Sec-Fetch-Mode`; the rate limiter outliving the process; Bangla forcing UCS-2
at 70 characters a segment; and two real schools sharing a display name.

Each of those cost real time here. An auditor who reads them first starts a day
ahead.

## Appendix B — the known-open list

So a pre-existing gap is not reported as a regression: every shut external
gate, the stale public deployment at `shikhon-lms.vercel.app`, the unused
`GET /sync/pull`, the unindexed board-registration column, the stale PRD audit,
and the seven backlog features deliberately not built. With an instruction to
**verify each is still true rather than assume it**.

## Three things the document insists on

1. **Do not trust the tests.** There are ~1160 and they pass, and this project
   has produced a test that passed for the wrong reason twice — once a suite
   reaching its cross-tenant assertion with a tenant still set, once a type
   gate red for six commits behind a green suite. The plan requires the auditor
   to **break ten important tests on purpose and confirm each one fails**.

2. **Do not trust the documentation** — including everything I have written.
   `README.md` claimed "Built and deployed" about seven services while nothing
   was deployed. Where code and documentation disagree, the code is the truth
   and the document is a bug.

3. **A refusal is only proved alongside a success.** Every isolation test needs
   the legitimate caller to succeed on the same route, because a broken
   endpoint and a secure one look identical from outside.

## What was deliberately NOT done

The audit itself. No application behaviour changed, no production configuration
touched, no gate turned green, and no evidence written to
`docs/production-evidence.json` — which still stands at 2 rehearsed, 1 blocked,
8 null. R-9 not started; its pilot gate stays closed.

## Next external dependency

Unchanged: one ordinary browser on a real machine to close the push gate, then
an SMS aggregator contract, then a production deployment.

---

# 2026-08-31 · R-8 external milestone · The product is deployed and public

**A real host and a real domain arrived, so the production-deployment gate —
open since R-8 began — is now closed.** ShikhonBD is live at
**https://sikhon.systems**. This entry records what was done, because it is the
first time any of this system has run somewhere a school could reach it.

## The provenance decision, made on evidence

The owner named `github.com/jmmohiuddin/LMS-SYSTEM` as the "main" repo. Before
deploying a system that will hold children's data, I compared it against the
verified local tree and surfaced what I found rather than deploying blind:
jmmohiuddin is an **Aug-23 snapshot** — 38 migrations, no onboarding console,
none of the R-8 hardening (**221 files / +72k lines behind**). The current,
audited product was never on either GitHub repo; it lives in the local working
tree at `0b6df00`. The owner chose to deploy that. So the deploy ships the
exact verified commit via `git archive`, not a GitHub clone.

## Coexistence, not takeover

The VPS (`voltix-prod`, Hostinger KVM2, Ubuntu 24.04) is **not a blank box** —
it already runs Voltix, Nexus, Meridian SATS, Meraki PMS and the owner's Nimikh
FOS API, with **Caddy owning 80/443**. So ShikhonBD was added **additively**:

- A **dedicated `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` container** (`shikhon-postgres`, port
  127.0.0.1:5433) — the same isolation pattern the sibling apps already use, so
  a new PG superuser was never created on the shared cluster that holds the
  other apps' data. pgvector 0.8.6, migrations run exactly as in CI.
- A **systemd service** (`shikhon-web`, unprivileged user, `ProtectSystem=full`)
  running `deploy/server.mjs` on `172.16.1.1:4100` — the same host-service
  pattern Caddy already uses for `accounting.phoyev.com`.
- **One added Caddy block** for `sikhon.systems`, appended after backing up the
  shared Caddyfile and validating before a graceful reload. The five sibling
  sites stayed up throughout (`accounting.phoyev.com` verified 200 after).

## The one piece of new code

`deploy/server.mjs` — a production HTTP server that reproduces what Vercel did:
serve the three static surfaces and route `/api/v1/<svc>` to the same
dispatcher the edge would have called. It is a hardened promotion of the
`.claude/static-server.mjs` that sat behind every R-7/R-8 browser acceptance,
so the routing is unchanged. Node 22.23's type-stripping runs the TypeScript
dispatchers directly (verified on the box). Committed as `52d1609`.

## Verified, on production

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| HTTPS | Valid Let's Encrypt cert, CN=sikhon.systems, through 2026-11-29 |
| Marketing / app / console | `/`, `/app`, `/platform` all 200 in a real browser, **zero console errors**, `shikhonBD` brand intact on the console (D11) |
| API auth | unauth 401, public 200, service-key 200 |
| DB posture | 48 migrations, 227 RLS policies, `shikhon_app`/`platform` non-super non-bypassrls, **0 tenants visible with no context** |
| **Restore drill (production)** | `restore-drill.mjs` on the production DB: every schema + table count identical, **RTO 1.5s**. Real production evidence, not a rehearsal |
| **Backups** | daily `pg_dump -Fc`, 14-day retention, first backup (913K) confirmed |
| Maintenance cron | ran once: partitions pre-created, dashboards refreshed |
| **Monitoring** | `/ops/monitor` every 15 min, evaluated against production, **all-clear** |
| Reboot survival | service enabled, container `unless-stopped`, cron in `/etc/cron.d` |
| Siblings | unaffected — no collateral damage to the shared box |

## Gates closed, and still open

**Closed with production evidence:** production deployment · apex DNS + TLS ·
backup configured · restore drill (production) · monitoring running.

**Still open — genuinely, not for lack of trying:**
- **Real SMS** — no aggregator contract. `OTP_SENDING_ENABLED` is off; login
  uses activation codes, so no SMS is needed to run a pilot.
- **Real push to a device** — the last blocker (no real HTTPS origin) is now
  gone: production has a valid cert and real VAPID keys. It is a ~10-minute
  test from any ordinary browser once a pilot tenant exists. Still `blocked`
  until observed on a device.
- **Alert to a human** — `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` unset; the monitor logs but pages
  nobody. One env var away.
- **Cross-tenant probe on production** — the probe needs ≥2 tenants and the DB
  has none yet. The DB-level RLS posture WAS verified on production directly.
- **Pilot** — 0 institutions. The wildcard-subdomain feature stays off;
  `/app?tid=` is the tenant door.

## R-8 status

**Still IN PROGRESS**, but materially advanced: the largest gate (a real
production deployment) is closed, and backup/restore now have production
evidence. What remains is an aggregator contract, an alert webhook, and a real
pilot — none of which is code.

## What the deploy did NOT do

No pilot school was onboarded (the ask was to host the site). The stale
`shikhon-lms.vercel.app` was left untouched. Nothing was pushed to GitHub — the
local tree remains the source of truth, and pushing it (to make a repo current)
is a separate decision the owner has not yet made.

# 2026-09-01 · UI/UX audit · Three generations of interface, and a decision that was never implemented

**Audit only. No redesign, no code changed, no file deleted.** This entry
records what the repository actually contains, because the owner reported that
`/app` looks materially different from the polished design they expected — and
the evidence says they are right, for a reason that is documented here for the
first time.

## The finding

There are **three** generations of interface in this repository, not two:

| Gen | Where | Palette | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `app.css` `--c-*` family | original app colours | **373 selectors** — nearly all of `/app` |
| 2 | `app.css` `--color-*` family | `#e53935`, `#f9fafb`, `#8b5cf6` (Material/Tailwind-ish) | **~30 selectors** — login, home/hero, buttons, `.card`, branding, notices |
| 3 | `design/tokens/*.css` — the real Ata Ekta system | `#D23B2E`, `#F1EFE6` Muslin, `#A76A47` Terracotta | **`/design` only** (and the UI kit) |

Generations 2 and 3 **share variable names and disagree on every value**.
`--color-primary` is `#e53935` in `/app` and `#D23B2E` in `/design`. Not one of
the six Ata Ekta colours appears anywhere in `app.css`.

The token file states its own reason: the red was deepened because `#e53935`
"sits at 3.9:1" and fails WCAG AA on white. **The Ata Ekta palette was written
as a correction to the palette `/app` still uses.**

## How it happened

Commit `c93bddc` (2026-08-23) is titled *"Add the ShikhonBD marketing landing
page and rebuild the app on the Ata Ekta design system"*. It did the first half.
It did **not** rebuild the app:

- it added `design/` (tokens + `.jsx` components) as a reference kit;
- it rewrote `index.html` into the marketing site (+4 274 lines);
- it added a *parallel* `--color-*` block to `app.css` whose values are **not**
  the Ata Ekta tokens;
- of **59** view modules under `apps/pwa/src/`, it changed exactly **one**
  (`login-view.ts`, 23 lines).

R-1-A later renamed that design surface to `design.html` (`/design`) and the
real shell to `app.html` (`/app`). The R-1-A discovery entry above already
recorded the file movement; what it did not record — and what this audit adds —
is that **the design system itself was never applied to the application.**

## Decision D7 has never been implemented

The Master Plan says, and has said since it was written:

> **D7 — New agent surfaces follow the Ata Ekta design system** (tokens in
> `apps/pwa/public/design/tokens/`).

`app.css` does not import those tokens and does not contain their values. Every
phase from R-1 to R-8 added UI to `app.css` in the older idiom. D7 is a
standing decision that the codebase has silently not followed — this is the
mismatch between product intent and implementation the audit was asked to find.

## What `/design` actually is

- **66 screens**, of which **32 are mobile/desktop PAIRS** (`s-attendance` +
  `s-attendance-desktop`, and so on) — the intentionally different desktop and
  mobile layouts the owner remembered.
- A **desktop shell** (`.dnav` sidebar, 9 `dpage-*` pages: dashboard, academic,
  attendance, students, teachers, results, finance, reports, settings).
- A **mobile shell** (`.phone` frame, `.bottomnav`).
- A hard **899/900px** split — genuinely separate layouts, not one fluid grid.

And it is **a mockup**: 1 `fetch` in the whole file (tenant branding), 0
imports, hardcoded arrays. The repository's own `surfaces.test.ts` asserts it —
*"/design is the prototype: many static screens, no API, no app boot"*. The
answer to "was the design ever connected to real functionality" is **no**.

## What `/app` actually is

Mobile-first and it stays that way. Its only `min-width: 900px` rule styles the
**branding editor's** two-column grid — nothing else. There is no sidebar, no
desktop navigation, no responsive table strategy; the `shell-tabbar` bottom nav
is what a desktop user gets too. That is why `/app` reads as a stretched phone
layout on a laptop.

Against that, `/app` holds everything `/design` does not: real API wiring across
26+ views, loading/empty/error states, the offline outbox, and a **122-line
dark palette** (F-1607) that `/design` has **no equivalent for at all**.

## Nothing was lost

`git log --diff-filter=D` over `design/` returns nothing. The hero assets are
referenced by `index.html`. Both HTML files were **moved and renamed**, never
deleted. Whatever else this is, it is not asset loss.

## Recommendation recorded

**Option B — `/design` is the intended visual system and should be integrated
into `/app`** — on the evidence of D7, of the tokens being an explicit WCAG
correction to `/app`'s palette, and of `/design` holding the desktop layouts
`/app` has never had.

With three constraints that the integration must respect, or it will regress
the product:

1. `/design` has **no dark mode**. `/app`'s 122-line dark palette must survive.
2. `/design` has **no loading, empty or error states**. D13 forbids trading
   those for visual polish.
3. `/design` covers roughly **33 of ~37** app routes. Notices/inbox, calendar,
   documents, user management, publish, invoices, rollover, audit, student
   history and the whole `/platform` console have **no design counterpart** and
   need new design work in the Ata Ekta idiom rather than a port.

The `.jsx` components under `design/components/` are **not** directly reusable:
React is not a dependency of this project and the app is deliberately
framework-free (D1). What is reusable is the token CSS and the plain HTML/CSS
patterns inside `design.html`.

**No redesign has been performed.** This entry exists so the decision is made
against evidence rather than memory.

# 2026-09-01 · UI integration plan · Ata Ekta becomes the app's visual direction

**Planning only. No application code changed, no screen redesigned, `/design`
untouched, routing/API/schema unchanged.**

Following the UI/UX audit entry above, the owner accepted **Option B**:
integrate the Ata Ekta design system from `/design` into the functional `/app`.
This entry records the decision and the roadmap; the plan itself lives in
[UI-UX-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md](UI-UX-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md) and is written to be
implementation-ready without chat history.

## The decision

**D14 (new, recorded in the Master Plan):** Ata Ekta is the canonical visual
direction for the functional `/app`. `/design` remains a visual reference and
prototype — it is not the production application and will not be promoted into
one.

## The finding that changed the estimate

Comparing `app.css` against `design/tokens/*.css` in detail produced a genuinely
good surprise: **radius, shadows, spacing and `--tap-min` already match the Ata
Ekta values exactly** — 8/12/16/999px, `0 1px 2px rgba(15,23,42,.04)` and the
rest, 4/8/12/16/24/32, 48px. Both surfaces already use Hind Siliguri and Inter.

So the two systems share their geometry and rhythm already. What actually
diverges is **colour** (every value) and the **type scale** (`/app` uses a px
ladder, `/design` a semantic h1…caption scale with weight and line-height
bundled). That reframes the work from "rewrite the design system" to "swap the
palette, reconcile the type scale, and build the desktop half that was never
built".

`/design` also carries one idea `/app` lacks and should adopt: `--font-bn-num`,
Noto Sans Bengali for **numerals only**, because Hind Siliguri's Bangla digits
are ambiguous with Latin `I`/`l` at table-row sizes — the wrong ambiguity for a
ledger balance or a mark.

## What the plan contains

Twenty sections: a token audit and migration (T1–T6, one token system at the
end, no permanent two-family tax); a three-generation cleanup classifying every
component group as KEEP / ADAPT / REPLACE / REMOVE AFTER MIGRATION with nothing
deleted yet; the final dual-mode shell (desktop `.d-shell` sidebar, mobile
bottom nav) with per-role navigation taken **verbatim from the existing
`dashboardFor(role)`** — no invented permissions; a 33-row screen-by-screen
matrix; a 26-component library specified for desktop, mobile, accessibility and
variants, marking what already exists so nothing is duplicated; and phases P0–P8
with tags and revert points.

## Three judgements worth recording

**Dark mode: keep it, as an explicit user preference.** `/app` ships a 122-line
dark palette (F-1607) applied before first paint; `/design` has none. Removing
shipped, tested behaviour to match a prototype that never addressed the question
would be a regression, and dark mode is an accessibility feature for low-light
use — a teacher marking attendance at 6am in a dim staffroom is a real case. So
a **dark Ata Ekta palette must be authored** as part of the token phase rather
than deferred, or the first phase would break dark mode.

**Breakpoints: 640 / 1024 / 1440, not the existing 900.** A real sidebar needs
~240px plus ≥720px of content, so 1024 is the honest switch point. Tablets
(640–1023) keep the bottom nav — a 768px tablet is held in hand. The existing
480/700/900 rules are absorbed, not stacked on top.

**Migration order: shell-first, then role-by-role.** Screen-by-screen would
leave two shells alive at once; role-by-role cannot start without a shell.
Shell-first front-loads the dependency, then each subsequent phase ends with a
complete, testable persona.

## Constraints carried into every phase

The plan states them as gates, not aspirations: `/design`'s hardcoded data may
never reach production (visual language only); the offline outbox path for
attendance and marks is restyled but never restructured, with offline
acceptance a gate on its phase; D11's three-way brand guard stays green;
D13's states are required per screen, and a screen that lands without them is
reported *"restyled — states pending"*, never complete; and the critical path
must not exceed today's 180 KB gzipped budget, with no framework introduced.

## Twelve screen families need new design

`/design` covers roughly 33 of ~37 routes. Student history, notices,
notifications, calendar, documents, user management, onboarding, the platform
console, publish, invoice, rollover and audit have **no** prototype counterpart.
They are scheduled after the component system exists (P6), so they are designed
*in* the Ata Ekta language rather than ported from screens that have no states
and no data.

## Status

**Nothing implemented. Awaiting approval to begin P0 (tokens + dark palette).**
The UI is not claimed complete; `/app` remains functionally strong and visually
a generation behind, which is exactly what the audit found.

# 2026-09-01 · Product surface architecture · Five surfaces, written down at last

**Specification only. No application code, routing, database, API, `design.html`,
`app.css` or deployment changed. P0 has not begun.**

The UI integration plan settled *how* the visual migration happens. This entry
settles *what surfaces exist and who reaches each one* — recorded as **D15** in
the Master Plan, specified in
[FINAL-PRODUCT-SURFACE-ARCHITECTURE.md](FINAL-PRODUCT-SURFACE-ARCHITECTURE.md).

## The five surfaces

| Address | Surface | Brand | Audience |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sikhon.systems/` | public marketing | **shikhonBD** | anyone |
| `/demo` (**new**) | isolated demo | tenant-style + marker | prospects |
| `<slug>.sikhon.systems` · `/app?tid=` | tenant application | **school** | a school's people |
| `platform.sikhon.systems` · `/platform` | Platform Console | **shikhonBD** | Super Admin only |
| `/design` | visual reference | tenant-style | developers only |

## Three findings from reading the code

**The subdomain plan is already built.** `tenantKeyFromHost()` in `branding.ts`
resolves by label count, not against a hardcoded domain, so
`monipur.sikhon.systems → monipur` needs **no code change** — and it already
reserves `www`, `app`, `platform`, `api`, `staging`, `localhost`. That last
point matters more than it looks: **`platform.sikhon.systems` can never be
mistaken for a tenant**, so moving the console to its own door is DNS and a
Caddy block, nothing more. The architecture asked for was already defended.

**The demo is isolated but homeless — and the fallback is a defect.** `demo.ts`
is entirely client-side ("no request ever leaves the device"), with all seven
roles as sample data. But there is no `/demo` route: the marketing CTA points at
`/app`, and `/app` enters demo mode implicitly whenever nobody is logged in:

```
demoMode = params.get('demo') === '1' || (!cachedOtpLogin() && !realAuth.isLoggedIn())
```

That second clause means **a real teacher who is simply logged out sees
fabricated students under their own school's door** — confusing on a personal
phone, misleading on a shared staffroom device. The specification gives the demo
its own route and its own banner, and makes a logged-out `/app` show the login
screen. Small change, real correctness fix.

**The domain drifted.** `shikhonbd.com` is still written into source comments,
two operator-facing Bangla strings, the marketing footer's contact address and
the default VAPID subject, while production serves `sikhon.systems`. **No logic
depends on it** — the resolver is domain-agnostic — so this is prose, not a
fault. Scheduled as housekeeping inside P7 rather than an urgent fix, and listed
so no future reader is misled by a stale string. `shikhonbd` remains the brand;
`sikhon.systems` is the address; D11 governs the brand, not the domain.

## What the specification fixes by construction

Naming the surfaces resolves two things that were true but unwritten: the
operator console shared an origin with the marketing site — the one surface that
should be hardest to find — and the demo had no identity of its own. Both are
now addressed by where things live, not by a rule somebody has to remember.

The console is **never** a public navigation destination: no link, no footer
entry, no sitemap presence. Publishing it would advertise the existence of a
customer list.

## What did not change

The tenant application remains **one** application with role-scoped navigation
(not five sites), driven by the **existing** `dashboardFor(role)` plus
`requireRole`/`requireStaff` and RLS — no permission is invented here. `?tid=`
keeps priority over the subdomain forever, because it is printed on admission
slips and baked into installed PWAs. No school-picker at any stage (D12).
`WILDCARD_DNS_READY` stays off until a browser has actually loaded a tenant
subdomain over HTTPS.

## Additions to the migration plan

Two items fold into P1 and P7 without changing the P0–P8 order: `/demo` as a
real route with the implicit-demo fallback removed (P1), and
`platform.sikhon.systems` as the preferred console door plus the domain-string
housekeeping (P7).

## Status

**Nothing implemented.** This document is the target; the integration plan is
the route. Awaiting approval to begin P0.

---

# 2026-09-01 · UI P0 · The palette moved, and the app did not notice

**Delivered. P1 has not begun.** One file changed: `apps/pwa/public/app.css`.
No TypeScript, no API, no schema, no routing, no `design.html`, no marketing
page. Rollback is a single `git checkout`.

## The discovery that set the scope

The plan budgeted P0 as "re-point the 373 `--c-*` selectors family by family".
Reading the file first showed that was unnecessary: `--c-*` is a **semantic
alias layer** of 29 tokens, and its own comment had promised exactly this —
*"the palette can be re-pointed at a different design system by editing this
block alone rather than 800 lines of rules."*

The promise held. The palette moved by editing the primitives and the aliases.
**424 usages and every one of the 59 view modules were untouched.** A phase
estimated in screens became a phase in one file, which is also why its rollback
is trivial.

## Colour, decided by measurement

Every value was run through a WCAG calculator against both grounds before
adoption, because the canonical palette is **not** automatically accessible:

- The brand red is the correction the design system exists for — `#e53935` was
  **4.23:1 on white and failed AA**; `#D23B2E` is 4.77:1.
- But five canonical hues fail **as text on the Muslin ground**: warning at
  **2.95:1**, accent-2 3.80, info 4.02, success 4.15, primary 4.14. Each got a
  `-text` step one shade darker — hue kept, step moved, which is the discipline
  the previous palette already used for the same reason.
- `--color-text-faint` (#97867B) is 3.03:1 on Muslin. It is kept because it is
  canonical, but **no text token aliases it** and a test now enforces that —
  it is precisely the defect `--c-ink-3` was created to fix, which had already
  shipped once across five screens.

## Typography — the canonical sizes were rejected, deliberately

Ata Ekta's body is 14px. This ladder's is 16px with a 13px chip floor, because
Bangla conjuncts lose legibility before Latin does at the same optical size
(Override 3, F-812). Adopting the canonical **sizes** would have shrunk every
screen and regressed the one thing this product cannot regress.

So the canonical **names** were adopted — h1/h2/h3/body/body-small/label/
caption — mapped onto the Bangla-tuned ladder, carrying weight and line-height
across but not size. Same vocabulary, same readability.

## Dark mode — kept and re-cut, not deferred

The plan's §8 decision was to keep dark mode as a user preference; P0 authored
the palette rather than leaving it for later, because a token phase that broke
dark mode would have been a regression shipped on purpose. The grounds are warm
Clove (`#1B1714` page, `#241E1A` card) — not the cool near-black they replace,
not the legacy green. Brand fills keep the light step so a primary button is
identical at midnight and noon; brand and status text move UP the ramp, the
mirror of how they move down in light. Every dark text step measures ≥4.8:1.

## Two defects, and how each was found

**`.system-row` had no background.** It is a `<button>`, so it inherited the
*user-agent button face* — harmless-looking in light, `#6B6B6B` under
`color-scheme: dark`, where the description text on it measures **2.59:1**. It
pre-dates P0 in both palettes and was invisible to every screenshot ever taken
of that screen. The rendered contrast sweep found it; looking would not have.

**The new test was wrong three times before it was right.** Its first run
reported tokens that exist only inside comments (this file's comments name
tokens deliberately, as records of fixed bugs). Its second missed tokens
declared several-per-line in the ramps. Its third flagged
`var(--c-danger, var(--c-primary))` — a deliberate fallback — as an undefined
token. Each was a false positive that would have taught a future reader to
ignore the test. A check that cries wolf is worse than no check, so each was
fixed before the test was trusted.

## Verification

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Rendered contrast sweep | **956 element-checks**, 12 routes × 2 themes → **0 failures** |
| Horizontal overflow | none at 1440 / 1024 / 390 / 375, both themes |
| Touch targets | 0 interactive elements under 44px |
| Tenant branding | A `#156a3f` and B `#1b3e7a` both render; grounds and status stay canonical |
| Tests | **1172** with a database (1160 before) |
| TypeScript ×3 | 0 / 0 / 0 |
| DB suites | 26/26 |
| D11 brand guard | pass, both directions |
| Security probe | **29/29** across 12 areas — tenant isolation unaffected |
| Secrets | clean across history |
| Size | `app.css` +2.6 KB gzipped (32.3 → 34.9). `app.js` unchanged — no TS touched |

## Legacy tokens: 29 definitions, 424 usages, unchanged

Deliberately. They all resolve to Ata Ekta primitives now. They are retired in
**P8**, when usage reaches zero, exactly as the plan says. Nothing deleted.

## What P0 did not do

No shell. `/app` remains mobile-first at every width, and its only desktop
breakpoint still styles the branding editor — so on a laptop it is still a
stretched phone layout with the correct colours. That is **P1**, and keeping it
out of P0 is what made this a one-file rollback.

**P1 has not begun.**


---

# P1 — Application shell: desktop and mobile   (2026-09-01)

**Commits:** `0466861` (A/B/C/D), `2c4d68d` (E/F), `HEAD` (G + docs).
**Scope:** the shell. Not the screens inside it — those are P2–P6.

## What the app was

A mobile shell a desktop browser could open. **One** `@media (min-width: …)`
rule existed in 2,542 lines of `app.css`, and it styled the branding editor;
every list, table and form was the phone layout stretched to the window. The
bottom bar was built from **route order**, which knows nothing about who is
holding the device, so a fourteen-year-old's phone offered "হাজিরা নিন" and a
section roster.

## What it is now

One DOM, two layouts, chosen by CSS. `display:none` removes a subtree from the
accessibility tree as well as the page, so a screen reader only ever meets the
navigation that is on screen. The alternative — re-rendering on resize — drops
focus, remounts the current route, and would lose a half-entered attendance
register when a phone is rotated.

| | ≥1024px | <1024px |
|---|---|---|
| Navigation | persistent grouped sidebar, 240px | bottom bar, 5 role-chosen tabs |
| 1024–1279 | 68px icon rail (forced) | — |
| Chrome | breadcrumb · search · bell · profile menu | identity · bell · profile |
| Content | centred column, max 1200px | full width |

`ui/nav.ts` **invents no permissions**. Every path it lists is already
registered and already reachable by every role through the unfiltered More
menu, which still closes every sidebar. Narrowing a sidebar changes what a
person is *offered*, never what they may do — the server decides that, and a
403 is the answer for anyone who should not.

## Defects found by rendering it

Five, none of which reading the code would have surfaced.

1. **The offline banner had been on screen for 58 commits.** `.offline-banner`
   sets `display:flex`, which beats the UA sheet's `[hidden]{display:none}` at
   equal specificity. `banner.hidden = navigator.onLine` was correct the whole
   time and did nothing: every user, every screen, online, has been reading
   "অফলাইন — কাজ চালিয়ে যান" since 2026-08-11. Fixed globally with
   `[hidden]{display:none !important}`, which also stops the next component
   that sets `display` on something it hides.
2. **The school's name rendered twice on desktop.** `.shell-org{display:flex}`
   was declared 1,700 lines below the rule hiding the mobile plate and won on
   source order. Both halves of the fix landed: the identity rules moved up
   beside the shell, and the responsive block now goes **last in the file**.
   That placement is load-bearing and is written into the stylesheet as a rule
   for every later phase.
3. **The icon rail never engaged.** It listened to `(max-width: 1279px)`;
   resizing 768 → 1024 does not change that query, so the band the rail exists
   for showed a 240px sidebar taking a quarter of a 1024px screen.
4. **My own demo chip was 1.85:1 in dark.** `--color-warning-ink` is the dark
   step in light mode and the *lifted* step in dark — its job is to be readable
   against its own ground, never to be a fill. Fill and label now come from the
   same pair and invert together: 6.0:1 light, 7.9:1 dark.
5. **`CARD.students` has asked for a `search` icon since R-6.** There isn't
   one, and `iconSvg`'s fallback is a silent neutral dot. A rail of icons with
   one meaningless dot in it is what made it visible.

## The one that was never P1's

A school may choose a pale brand — a yellow crest, a light teal. `app.css` put
white on the brand fill in **seventeen** places: the primary button, the
notification badge, the avatar, the calendar's selected day, the audience
chips. On `#E5B300` that is **1.95:1**. Worse, `--c-primary-text` on
`--c-primary-soft` measured **3.38:1**, and that pair paints the **active
sidebar row** — a school with a yellow crest could not read which page it was
on.

The branding editor has warned about this since R-1 ("advice, not a refusal" —
a school may have a light brand and we do not get to veto it). Nothing acted on
the warning, so choosing a pale colour quietly degraded every screen at once.

`brandingCssVars` now derives `--c-on-primary` and steps the text colour until
it clears AA, **in the school's own hue** rather than a neutral — black on a
yellow button reads as a different palette leaking in. The fill stays exactly
the colour the school chose; only the label moves. Verified across yellow,
teal, near-white, white, black and grey, in both themes, and **byte-identical**
for every brand that never needed help.

## And one the stability gate stumbled into

`generateVapidKeys` returned a **31-byte private key 0.41% of the time** (83 in
20,000 measured). Node's `getPrivateKey()` trims leading zero bytes; the PKCS#8
envelope is fixed-width DER declaring 32, so those pairs throw on every send.

Not a test flake. The pair is minted **once per deployment and kept**: a school
unlucky at setup would have had push silently dead for its whole life — with
R-8's "push verified on a real device" gate still open to explain it away.
Left-padding restores what SEC 1 §2.3.7 already says a P-256 scalar is.

## Verification

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Rendered sweep | **3,000+ element-checks** — 8 widths × 2 themes × 5 roles × 12 routes |
| Contrast | **0 failures** at 375 / 390 / 640 / 768 / 1024 / 1280 / 1440 / 1600, both themes |
| Horizontal overflow | **none** at any width |
| Touch targets | 0 under 44px; `pointer: coarse` restores 48px on the sidebar |
| Accessible names | 0 nameless controls, menu open and closed |
| Keyboard | skip link is the first stop; focus order skip → rail → sidebar → content |

**Security probe: not run.** It needs a seeded two-tenant deployment and this
machine's CI database has none. P1 changed no RLS, auth, API or tenant
resolution, so there is nothing in it for the probe to see — but that is an
argument, not evidence, and it is recorded as unrun rather than as a pass.

## What P1 did not do

The screens inside the shell. Dashboards are still card grids (reflowed to four
columns on desktop, not redesigned); tables are still tables at every width;
`.page-header` is still whatever each of 26 views renders. Those are **P2–P6**,
and keeping them out is what makes P1 reviewable.

**P2 has not begun.**

# D16 — the Platform Console owns the commercial relationship   (2026-09-01)

Recorded before P2 begins, because the owner raised it as a requirement and a
requirement that is not written down gets invented ad hoc inside whichever
phase first trips over it.

## What was already true

`tenants` has carried the commercial columns since **migration 001**:
`plan_code`, `student_cap`, `trial_ends_on`, `status`
(`trial | active | suspended | archived`), and a `features jsonb` that nothing
has ever read. Migration **045** gave the platform `app.create_tenant()`,
`app.set_tenant_status()`, `app.platform_tenants()`, `app.log_platform_action()`
and `app.enforce_student_cap()`, all `SECURITY DEFINER`, granted to
`shikhon_platform` and to nobody else — `shikhon_app` cannot execute one of
them, so a fully compromised school application still cannot suspend a school.

So an operator can already suspend a tenant. What they cannot do is say **why**,
record that a school **paid**, or tell a school two days late from one three
months gone.

## What R-7 said, and what it got wrong

> "Billing the schools is **out of scope** for R-7 — invoicing is manual, and a
> payments integration for our own subscriptions is a separate decision."

Right about the gateway. Wrong about the model. Those are different things: a
gateway is an integration; the commercial state is a *fact about a school* that
the product already half-stores. Without a payment record the lifecycle has no
input, so suspension becomes a judgement someone makes in a spreadsheet and
applies by hand — which is precisely the state in which a paying school gets
locked out and an unpaying one does not.

The R-7 sentence is **kept verbatim** in the Master Plan (D10) with a
supersession note beside it.

## What D16 requires

| Area | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Institution | profile · tenant id · type · slug · status |
| Subscription | plan · billing cycle · price · student cap · enabled modules · start date · next due date · trial · grace period |
| Payment | amount · date · method · reference · note · history · outstanding balance |
| Lifecycle | `active → payment_due → grace_period → limited → suspended`, **derived from the payment record**, never typed in |
| Reactivation | payment recorded → re-evaluate → reactivate, one platform action |
| Audit | every commercial act writes `audit.platform_access` **in the same transaction as the act** (the 045 rule, unchanged) |
| Isolation | no tenant role reaches any of it — principal, IT admin, teacher, student, guardian alike |
| Data | **suspension is an access state, never a data operation.** No deletion, no anonymisation, no export block (R-7.11, unchanged and now load-bearing) |

Explicitly **not** authorised: an online payment gateway. Manual recording is
the whole of the requirement at this business stage. A gateway is a separate
phase requiring its own approval.

## Schema this will need (P7, not now)

- `tenant_status` gains `payment_due`, `grace_period`, `limited` — an enum
  extension, so forward and rollback both need writing carefully.
- A `subscription` and a `payment` table, both under D8: `tenant_id`,
  `app.enforce_tenant()`, RLS, rollback file, probe in `migration-status.mjs`.
- `features jsonb` finally gets a reader — the module entitlement set.

Nothing is built now. **Implementation is P7.** P2–P6 are UI phases.

## "100% customisable", bounded

The operator configures *supported settings* without editing code: identity,
branding, academic structure, subjects, users, student cap, plans, enabled
modules, notification policy, calendar, fee configuration, subscription state.

It does **not** mean arbitrary code, HTML, SQL or runtime scripting from an
admin screen. That is not customisation, it is a remote-execution feature with
a friendly name, and D4 already forbids its cousin (per-school code).

# P2 — the shared component system   (2026-09-01)

**Commit:** `6145592`. Eleven modules under `apps/pwa/src/ui/`, one import for
every screen built from P3 onward.

## Built against the duplication that is actually there

Measured before writing anything:

| Pattern | Files | Uses |
|---|---|---|
| Hand-built `.page-header` (the same 7 lines) | 29 | 37 |
| Hand-typed button class strings | 44 | 130 |
| `createElement('table')` | 9 | 9 |
| Field constructions | 24 | 268 |

None of the 268 fields associated its label, helper and error with its input;
none of the 9 tables had a mobile form; none of the 130 buttons guaranteed
`type="button"` or guarded a double submit.

## The piece that mattered most

§7 wants a table on desktop and a list on a phone. The only way both stay
correct is **one column declaration producing both** — a list is not a table
with the borders removed, it is the same record with a different thing in
charge of it. Each column declares what it is on a phone (`title` /
`subtitle` / `meta` / `status` / `hidden`), and the list carries each value's
column header as visually-hidden text, because on a list there is no header row
and "০১৭xxxxxxxx" read without "অভিভাবকের ফোন" is a number from nowhere.

Both renderings live in the DOM and a media query hides one — the shell's
decision from P1, for the same reason: `display:none` removes a subtree from
the accessibility tree as well as the page, so a screen reader meets exactly
one. `pagination()` exists so row counts stay bounded, since the cost is about
five extra nodes per row.

## What rendering it caught that no unit test could

The gallery renders every component with every state on one page. Five defects,
all found by looking, none findable by asserting:

1. **`.btn-primary` has been `width: 100%` since the app was phone-only.**
   There has never been an intrinsic-width primary button, so a "save" in a
   table row or a page header stretched the whole column. Fixed behind a
   `ui-btn` marker so the 130 legacy call sites keep the full-width bar they
   were written for.
2. **`.btn-primary` computes to `display: block`**, so a glyph, a label and a
   spinner inside it laid out as inline flow — the busy spinner rendered as a
   4×30 vertical bar. Legacy buttons contain one text node and never noticed.
3. **The stacked action order did the opposite of its own comment.**
   `column-reverse` put the primary on top; the comment said "under the thumb".
   One rule now: DOM order is priority order, least important first.
4. **Breadcrumb links measured 23px** — one pixel under WCAG 2.2 AA's target
   minimum.
5. **The four light-theme status tints were still the pre-Ata-Ekta palette.**
   P0 moved the grounds, the ink ramp, the brand and the DARK equivalents of
   these same four. These survived because they were hand-set hex rather than
   aliases, so re-pointing the alias layer never reached them — and `#e8eef7`,
   a cool blue-grey on a warm Muslin ground, still cleared 4.98:1, so no
   contrast test failed. `--c-danger-soft` was the worst: it aliased
   `--color-accent-100`, the BRAND ramp's palest step, so "absent" and
   "primary" had been drawing from one token by coincidence rather than by
   intent. All four are canonical now; ratios measured at 4.74 / 5.20 / 4.90 /
   4.93.

One further note, recorded because it is the kind of thing that becomes a
false memory: a dark-theme sweep reported two contrast failures on
`.btn-danger`. They were an artifact of flipping `data-theme` mid-batch and
measuring a half-updated tree — the direct measurement is 6.6:1, and a clean
reload shows zero. Chasing it is what found defect 5, so the bad measurement
earned its keep, but it was not a defect.

## Adoption

`pageHeader()` adopted in the 18 views that build its exact DOM: **90 lines in,
144 out**, byte-identical output, zero visual change. The other 11 deviate —
a conditional subtitle, an extra child — and are left for the phase that
redesigns them, which is where they were going to be touched anyway.

## The gallery is not deployable, structurally

Source in `apps/pwa/dev/`, built on demand by `scripts/build-gallery.mjs`, both
outputs gitignored. Everything under `public/` is deployed, and a component
gallery served from a school's own domain is a platform page on a tenant
surface (D11). It is also the only caller that exercises every component
signature at once, so `tsconfig.json` now includes `dev/` — a type error there
is a real API break.

## Verification

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Contrast | **0 failures** at 360 / 375 / 390 / 1024 / 1280 / 1440, light and dark |
| Element checks | ~150 per configuration, 12 configurations |
| Horizontal overflow | none at any width, including 360 |
| Accessible names | 0 nameless controls |
| Focus trap | measured live: focus in → Cancel, siblings `aria-hidden`, survives Escape when non-dismissible, focus returns to opener, `aria-hidden` restored |
| Tests | **1,315** with a database (1,224 before) — 91 new component tests |
| TypeScript ×3 | 0 / 0 / 0 (now including the gallery) |
| Migrations | 48/48, schema untouched |
| D11 brand guard | pass |
| Secrets | clean |
| `app.css` | 39.1 → **45.7 KB gzipped** (+6.6) |
| `app.js` | 132.9 → **133.3 KB gzipped** (+0.4) — the modules tree-shake, so nothing but `pageHeader` ships until P3 uses it |

Remaining below the 44px iOS guideline and deliberately so: breadcrumb links
(24px, WCAG 2.2 AA's minimum, and inline-exempt) and filter chips (34px with a
fine pointer, 48px under `pointer: coarse`).

## What P2 deliberately did not build

**A DatePicker.** `field({ kind: 'date' })` is `<input type="date">`, which
opens the OS picker, is localised by the phone, works offline and costs
nothing. A hand-built calendar popover would be kilobytes on the critical path
(04-UIUX §6) to reproduce something the platform does better.

**A charting primitive.** 04-UIUX §6: charts are server-rendered inline SVG and
no charting library ships to the client. Nothing here draws a chart, so nothing
here can become the reason one gets installed.

**A style or colour prop on anything.** Every visual decision resolves to a
token. A component that accepts a colour will be given one outside the palette.

**The screens.** P2 is the system; P3–P6 are the screens.

# P3 — the teacher experience   (2026-09-01)

**Commits:** `5959975` (A/B), and the commit this entry lands with.
**Scope:** the six teacher screens, on the P0–P2 foundation.

## Step 0, first: the work was on one machine

The audit that preceded this phase found the ten commits carrying D14, D15,
P0, P1, D16 and P2 existed **only in this working tree** — `origin/main` was
still at `e7df9c2`. They were pushed before any P3 code was written:
fast-forward, no history rewritten, `origin/main` now at the same commit as
HEAD. That risk is closed and is recorded here because it was the largest one
the audit found and it had nothing to do with code quality.

## The dashboard

Every role landed on the same grid of feature tiles — a screen that answers
*what CAN I do* for a person who arrived asking *what do I do NOW*. A teacher
opening the app at 8:20 wants the class about to start and whether its register
is in.

Built entirely from `GET /rms/routine?scope=day`, which already returned every
field needed: period, time, subject, section, room, `isSubstitution`,
`coveringForBn`, `studentCount` and — decisively — **`attendanceTaken`**. It
wraps `app.teacher_day()`, so substitutions are already merged and the
authorization is the routine screen's. No endpoint, no migration, no
permission.

The urgent card is **derived on every render** — the period happening now whose
register is missing, else the next — never stored. A stored "next action" goes
stale the moment a register is taken on another device, and a shared staffroom
phone is the normal case.

**Exactly one dominant action**, and when every register is in there is none at
all: the card is replaced by a sentence saying so. A dashboard that always has
a big button teaches people to ignore it.

## Attendance

`AttendanceView` and its save path are untouched — that path is the product's
one durable write. What P3 added is the eleven moments around it, and the
removal of a fabrication.

The route used to build the screen from a cache written by a **different**
screen, falling back to:

    section: { id: 'demo-section', labelBn: '৯-ক', academicYearId: 'yr-2026' }

A teacher who opened হাজিরা before ever visiting the roster saw a real-looking
class that does not exist, and any save was rejected by sync because
`yr-2026` is not a uuid — the screen could only say "১টি পাঠানো যায়নি". The
screen asks the server now. With the fallback gone, **60 fabricated placeholder
students** and two loader helpers became dead code and were deleted.

Three states that did not exist:

- **Empty** — a section with no students, named, with a way out. A school's
  first day is all-empty and nothing has gone wrong.
- **Loading** — a list skeleton instead of a blank grid.
- **Retry** — the chip has said "৩টি পাঠানো যায়নি" since R-0 with nothing to do
  about it. There is now a line saying the data is safe on the device and a
  button that flushes.

Plus a double-submit guard (three taps enqueued three registers), a busy save
button, and seven facts in words: section · date · subject · period · students
· hand-marked · sync state.

**"Marked" counts `touched`, not tiles with a status.** `AttendanceGrid` starts
every student at `present`, so the naive count is the class size from the first
frame — a reassuring lie. The label reads "হাতে চিহ্নিত" for the same reason,
and the authoritative tally stays the grid's own present/absent/late counters.

## Roster, routine, marks, scripts

- **Roster** moved onto the shared `dataTable`: a table on a laptop, cards on a
  phone, one column declaration. The activation-code path is untouched.
- **Routine** got a real tab strip (roving tabindex, arrow keys) and a
  substitution that **explains itself** — the old tag said "পরিবর্তী ক্লাস",
  which names the fact and answers none of the question a teacher standing in
  an unfamiliar corridor is asking. Non-teaching slots also stopped rendering
  the raw enum: a break used to print the literal string `break` on a Bangla
  screen.
- **Marks** gained the guard it lacked. `dirty.size === 0` was the only one and
  it is cleared *after* the enqueue loop, so two taps on a slow phone enqueued
  the same marks twice with two different op ids and no de-duplication. A
  failed enqueue now keeps the typed numbers on screen. Published marks were
  already read-only; nothing said **why**, so a teacher fixing a typo met a
  form that silently refused keystrokes.
- **Scripts** stopped asking a teacher to type UUIDs. Two free-text boxes
  labelled `exam_subject uuid` and `student uuid` — §15's rule broken, and a
  screen nobody could use, because there is nowhere in the product to see a
  uuid. Three named pickers now, from the same three endpoints the marks and
  roster screens already call. The compression and upload architecture is
  unchanged.

## Verification

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Rendered sweep | **3,010 element-checks** — 6 widths × light/dark × 2 tenants × 6 screens |
| Contrast | **0 failures** at 360 / 375 / 390 / 1024 / 1280 / 1440, both themes |
| Horizontal overflow | **none**, including 360 |
| Accessible names | 0 nameless controls |
| Tenant A / B | `#156a3f` and `#1b3e7a` — 0 failures each |
| Teacher scoping | 70 DB tests, incl. "a class teacher searches their own section, not the school" and "a teacher naming another section's student by code still gets nothing" |
| Tests | **1,038** without a database (1,019 before) — 19 new |
| TypeScript ×3 | 0 / 0 / 0 |
| `index.html` | byte-identical — verified by diff |

## Offline: what is proven, and what is not

The **durability** of the queue is proved in `packages/offline` — 46 tests
including *60 students marked offline and synced when the tower comes back*, *a
duplicate ack removes the op so a reinstall cannot double-post*, *exhausting
the retry budget parks the op rather than deleting it*, and *a user-triggered
retry re-arms a failed op*. P3 did not touch that path and does not repeat
those tests.

The **UI for those states** is what P3 built, and it is proved by 19 new tests
driving `AttendanceScreen` with a controllable outbox: queued renders, failed
renders with a working retry, offline says the data is on the device rather
than sent, a cached roster survives the network being gone, three taps enqueue
one register.

**Not proven: the full browser → server → database round trip.** Demo mode
answers locally, so its queue drains and cannot exercise the offline path; the
CI database has 0 tenants, so there is no seeded school to sync against. This
is recorded as unproven rather than claimed — the steps §"OFFLINE ACCEPTANCE"
lists as 7–11 (reconnect, sync, verify server result, retry a failed sync,
verify no duplicate records) need a seeded tenant and are the same gate the
pilot closes.

## What P3 did not do

Student, guardian, principal and IT-admin screens (P4/P5). The teacher's
`assignments`, `substitute` and `classperf` screens keep their legacy markup —
they are reached from More, not from the teaching day, and they belong to the
phase that redesigns their role's surface.

# P3.1 — stability gate   (2026-09-01)

Two defects fixed, both found by running things rather than reading them.

## 1. `ward.test.ts` failed on three days of every month

**Root cause, proven in PostgreSQL.** `monthPercent` is month-to-date by
design — the endpoint scopes on `taken_on >= date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE)`
and the guardian screen renders the result as **"এ মাসে ৯৪%"**. That contract
is correct and was not changed.

The FIXTURE walked backwards from today with
`generate_series(CURRENT_DATE - 3, CURRENT_DATE)`, silently assuming four
consecutive days always share a calendar month. Queried directly on
2026-09-01:

```
 day          counted
 2026-08-29   false
 2026-08-30   false
 2026-08-31   false
 2026-09-01   true      ← only the 'present' day survives the month filter
```

One present of one counted = **100%**, against an expected 67. The test
therefore failed on the **1st, 2nd and 3rd of every month** and passed on the
other twenty-eight — which is worse than failing always, because it reads as a
flake.

**Fix — in the test only.** The window is now anchored to always contain today
*and* lie inside the current month: it starts up to three days back, clamped at
the month's first day, and extends forward to make four. Every month has at
least 28 days, so month-start + 3 always exists. Statuses are assigned relative
to today rather than by fixed offset, because today's position in the window
now varies.

Verified across every edge date — 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 15th, 29th, 30th,
Feb 28th, Jan 31st, Dec 31st: four days, all in-month, always including today.

## 2. Every attendance tile announced "undefined"

Introduced by P3 and caught by the browser regression, not by any test or by
`tsc`. `GET /academics/roster` returns `fullName: { bn, en }`; the new
attendance screen declared `{ studentId, rollNo, nameBn }` and read `r.nameBn`.
That compiles — the response is parsed from JSON — and produces `undefined`.

Nothing looked wrong. The tile shows a roll number and a status glyph; the name
only reaches `title` and `aria-label`. A screen reader announced
**"রোল 1, undefined, উপস্থিত"** for every child in the class.

The code P3 replaced had mapped it correctly, so this was a regression. The
type is now imported from `roster-view.ts` rather than re-declared — the same
correction the section shape needed earlier in P3, and for the same reason. A
test now asserts no tile is ever announced as "undefined", including rows with
an English-only name and rows with no name at all.

## Gate

| Save path | `packages/offline` untouched; `attendance-view.ts` +18/−1, header only |
| `index.html` | SHA identical at `52d1609`, `9e3f604`, `2e0a54b`, HEAD |

## Attendance states, re-verified in a browser

present → absent → late → present (tap cycle) · saving (`disabled`,
`aria-busy`) · saved (chip, snackbar, toast) · offline (shell banner + screen
note) · save-while-offline ("এই যন্ত্রে সংরক্ষিত — সংযোগ পেলে নিজেই জমা হবে") ·
back-online (note clears).

**queued / sync-failed / retry** are covered by the 20 unit tests rather than
the browser: demo mode answers locally, so its queue drains and those states
cannot be produced there. Unchanged from P3, and recorded as such.

**"Unmarked" does not exist.** `AttendanceGrid` starts every student at
`present`; the register is a list of exceptions, not a set of blanks. The
screen reports "হাতে চিহ্নিত N / M" — how many the teacher has actually
decided about — which is the honest form of the same question.

# P4 — Student + Guardian final production UI/UX   (2026-09-01)

Two personas, nineteen screens, and five defects that only appeared because
somebody drove the product instead of reading it. The child selector is the
piece the brief called CRITICAL and it is the piece the most care went into;
the three privacy findings are the ones that would have mattered most had they
shipped.

## What was built

### The child selector (§3) — `apps/pwa/src/ui/child-selector.ts`

One component, three behaviours, and the threshold between them is about
screen width rather than taste:

| Children | What renders | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 0 or 1 | nothing (identity block only) | a control with one option teaches people their tap did nothing |
| 2–3 | an inline strip, both names permanently visible | a collapsed dropdown answers "which child" only *after* you tap it, which is the moment the answer stops mattering |
| 4+ | a button naming the current child, opening a sheet | side-by-side stops fitting 360 px; the current child stays named on the button |

The accessible name carries the class as well as the name — `আনিকা রহমান —
নবম–ক` — because "আনিকা" and "আনিকা" are two different children in more
Bangladeshi families than not, and this is the one control that must never be
ambiguous. Roving tabindex, so Tab leaves the strip for the content instead of
walking every child. Arrow/Home/End move within it. Every change announces
into a live region, because the whole page is about to change underneath
somebody who may not see it change.

`childIdentity()` renders whose screen this is, above the content, on every
guardian screen that shows one child's data — so the answer survives a
back-navigation, a reload, or a week away from the app. The roll number stays
in Latin digits (`formatIdentifier`): it is what a guardian reads down the
phone to the school office, and "রোল ০১" cannot be checked against a paper
register.

### The student home (§4) — `apps/pwa/src/student-home-view.ts`

Four independent requests — `/academics/next`, `/academics/attendance`,
`/academics/results`, `/ops/inbox` — each repainting as it lands. Four
sequential requests on a 2G connection would be four seconds of blank screen;
independent ones mean a slow inbox never holds up the homework due today.

**What it deliberately does not show, and why.** §4 lists today's class routine
first. The product cannot answer it: `GET /rms/routine` wraps
`app.teacher_day(claims.sub, …)`, so a student calling it gets their own —
empty — teaching day, not their section's timetable. There is no
student-facing routine endpoint. Inventing a plausible one on the client would
be fabricated curriculum data, which §10 forbids in the same breath as asking
for the card. The gap is named here rather than papered over with a card that
would be right for a teacher and wrong here. **This is P5 work: one endpoint,
section-scoped.**

### The guardian home — migrated, not rewritten

`guardian-view.ts` kept everything that already worked — cache-first paint,
the selector present even mid-load, `select()` clearing `home` *before* the
fetch — and moved its rendering onto the P2 components. The 17 existing tests
were re-pointed at the new DOM with every assertion's meaning preserved. One
could not survive verbatim: the fee card's overdue tone was `danger`, and the
shared stat card's tones are the palette's semantic set, which has no `danger`
step. Overdue takes `warn`. That is a rename, not a loosening — the property
the test exists to guard is that an overdue bill *reads* differently, and
F-812 requires that difference to be in words rather than in a tint, so the
words are what is now asserted.

## §21 — privacy, proven against PostgreSQL

`services/academics-svc/test/p4-privacy.test.ts`, 11 tests, two tenants, real
RLS. Positive and negative both, because a test that only checks what a role
CAN see passes just as happily when the answer is "everything":

- a student reads their own attendance, results, fees — and **cannot** name
  another student's id to read theirs
- a guardian reads each of their own children — and **cannot** reach a child
  who is not theirs, including one in the same section
- tenant A's guardian, given tenant B's student id, gets nothing: not an
  error that confirms the id exists, nothing
- the ward endpoint returns only the children actually linked, not the class

Six iterations to get the fixture right, and each failure was the database
refusing to hold something untrue:

1. `7a4p0000` is not a uuid — `p` is not hex.
2. `users_pkey` — Rahim fathers two children and so appeared twice in the
   guardian array. People and links are now separate.
3. "has no phone, no email and no contactable guardian" — the adults needed
   phone numbers.
4. `users_phone_e164_check` — `+8801` takes **nine** more digits; I had eight.
5. Tenant B's only student had no guardian at all.
6. Eleven tests cancelled: a top-level `before` does not gate `describe`s in
   `node:test`. Memoised `ensureSetup()` per suite instead.
7. And the one worth keeping: **`drop()` deleted both tenants under tenant A's
   context, and RLS correctly hid tenant B**, so B survived and the next run
   hit `tenants_pkey`. RLS scopes DELETE too. Each tenant is now dropped in
   its own context.

## §22 — switching children, measured

Clicking the other child and reading the DOM synchronously, before any await:

The old child's numbers never coexist with the new child's name. That is the
property, and it is now measured rather than asserted.

## Defects found and fixed

### 1. The demo's staff gate was one path wide; the product's is seven

Found by driving the preview **as a guardian** and typing a teacher's URL.
`#/roster` painted a class register — twelve children's names and roll
numbers. `#/marks`, `#/attendance` and the routine did the same.

In production none of those requests are answered: `requireStaff` refuses a
guardian at `academics/{roster,sections,exams,marks}`, `rms/routine` and
`ops/structure`. Registering every route for every role is deliberate (R-3:
"the endpoints and RLS are the enforcement, and a route that 403s honestly is
better than one that 404s confusingly") — and that is exactly why the demo has
to reproduce the 403, because in the demo there is no RLS and no endpoint,
only `DEMO_STAFF_ONLY`, and it held one path.

`apps/pwa/test/demo-gate.test.ts` now **derives** the expectation from the
services: every module under `services/*/api` that calls `requireStaff(claims)`
on a GET must be refused in the demo. A staff-only endpoint added next year
fails the test until the demo refuses it too. The two POST-only gates
(`assignments`, `scripts`) are excluded on purpose — their reads are what a
student's own homework list is built from, and over-blocking makes the preview
look broken to the audience it exists for. Verified by removing one path and
watching the test go red.

### 2. …and the gate alone was not enough

With the gate in place the roster **still** painted names, under an "অফলাইন —
সর্বশেষ সংরক্ষিত" banner. Every read-through cache in this app is a
`shikhon_*` **localStorage** key, written synchronously so a cold start has
something to draw. Every demo role shares one origin. The guardian was reading
the teacher's cache.

A real guardian cannot reach that state — they never held a teacher session —
but a prospective school reaches it in two clicks of the role picker, on the
public preview, and what they see is a parent reading a class register. The
picker now purges before reloading. It is a **keep-list**, not a delete-list:
identity (`auth`, `tid`, the demo selectors, the device id), branding, and
three device preferences survive; every other `shikhon_` key goes, so a cache
added next month is dropped by default.

Deliberately scoped to the demo picker. `doLogout` is a different question —
a real session ending on a shared device — and it touches the sync outbox,
which may hold a teacher's unsent attendance. **Losing that is worse than a
stale screen, and P4 is not where that gets decided. It is the first item on
P5's list.**

### 3. Tenant B's active tab label was 4.42:1 in dark mode

On every mobile screen in the product, for any school whose brand needed the
correction. `--c-primary-text` is derived to clear AA **on the brand-soft
tint** — correct for the chips it was written for, and blind to the other
ground app.css puts it on: the plain card surface, which carries links,
breadcrumb hover, stat values, and the active bottom-bar tab.

`readableBrandText` now takes a *list* of grounds and only stops stepping when
all of them clear 4.5:1. Six brands checked, including the hostile ones:

| Brand | dark, before | dark, after |
|---|---|---|
| tenant B `#1b3e7a` | **4.42** | 5.01 |
| tenant A `#156a3f` | 5.42 | 5.42 |
| pale yellow `#E5B300` | 9.81 | 9.81 |

Two tests now hold it: `branding.test.ts` checks the derived colour on the
card surface for eight brands in both themes, and `design-tokens.test.ts`
checks that `branding.ts`'s two surface literals still match what app.css
actually defines — the module is framework-free and cannot read the
stylesheet, so the copies are compared rather than trusted.

The default palette was already fine on that ground. Only tenant-derived
colours were wrong, which is why no screenshot of the default build showed it.

### 4. The avatar palette said "AA" and one tint was not

`#A76A47` carries white at **4.38:1** at 11 px — the `.is-sm` avatar, which is
what the child selector strip uses. The comment above the six tints claimed
each was "chosen to carry white at AA". Five were. Moved to `#96603E`
(5.20:1), same hue, and every tint now carries its measured ratio in the
stylesheet beside it.

### 5. The demo served the teacher's subject list to students

`/api/v1/academics/subjects` returned `R3_SUBJECTS` — the teacher's bare
`{id, nameBn, nameEn}` — where the student screen expects chapter counts. The
accessible name came out as **"পদার্থবিজ্ঞান: undefinedটির মধ্যে undefinedটি
অধ্যায় শেষ"**, read aloud, on five subjects. The route now returns
`DEMO_SUBJECTS`, and `subjects-view.ts` coerces defensively so the view cannot
emit the word "undefined" even with a field missing — `String(undefined)` is
something a screen reader says out loud.

## Two measurement artifacts, recorded as non-defects

Both were reported as contrast failures by the sweep and neither is real:

- `.shell-tab-label` at 4.42:1 and `.dnav-label` at 2.31:1 appeared only in
  the first frames after a theme flip. `.shell-tab` and `.dnav-label` both
  carry `transition: color`, so a probe that measures immediately reads a
  blend of the two palettes. Injecting
  `*{transition:none!important;animation:none!important}` before measuring
  removed the whole class of them, and the settled values are 5.01 and 7.03.

The same trap produced P2's phantom dark-mode failures. It is now written down
so the next sweep starts with the freeze rather than discovering it again.

## Browser acceptance

48 configurations: **2 personas × 2 tenants × 6 widths × 2 themes**, every
student and guardian route, transitions frozen.

| | 1440 | 1280 | 1024 | 390 | 375 | 360 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| student, tenant A | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ |
| student, tenant B | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ |
| guardian, tenant A | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ |
| guardian, tenant B | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ | ✅ ✅ |

(light ✅ dark ✅ per cell)

**~15,900 element-checks. 0 contrast failures. 0 horizontal overflow.
0 nameless controls. 0 `undefined`/`null`/UUID in any accessible name.**

`d-rail-toggle` is 32×32 — below the 44 px the probe asks for and above WCAG
2.2 AA's 24 px. It is a desktop-only, `pointer: fine` control and is left as
it is; the mobile surfaces have no sub-44 targets at all.

### Long content, at 360

Fifty-nine strings replaced with pathological ones — a 43-character Bangla
name, a 62-character institution name, a full sentence as an assignment title
— and measured live:

- no horizontal page scroll
- the only clipped element is `.shell-org-name`, which is
  `white-space: nowrap; text-overflow: ellipsis` by design
- the child strip's options hold 176 × 60 px and ellipsise
- the identity block wraps to two lines and stays inside the viewport

## Gate

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Full suite, run 1 | **1,352 passing**, 12 workspaces |
| Full suite, run 2 | **1,352 passing** — re-runnable |
| §21 privacy suite | 11/11, twice |
| Guardian view tests | 17/17 |
| TypeScript ×3 | 0 / 0 / 0 |
| Build | app.js + sw.js + 11 API bundles |
| Browser sweep | **~15,900 checks** across 48 configurations, 0 failures |
| `index.html` | SHA `496199bd` — identical at `2e0a54b`, `9e3f604`, `52d1609`, `f62b8db`, HEAD **and the working tree** |
| Landing isolation | `index.html` loads only `/design/tokens/*.css`; it has never loaded `app.css`, so P4's stylesheet work cannot reach it |

## What P4 did not do

- **No API, schema or permission changes.** The only server-side file P4
  touched is a new test.
- **No D16 commercial controls.** Nothing about ShikhonBD's own subscription
  appears on a student or guardian screen; school tuition is a different thing
  and is the only money either persona sees.
- **The remaining student screens still render themselves.** `my-attendance`,
  `results`, `assignments`, `fees`, `documents`, `learn` and `subjects` — seven
  views — predate P2 and are accessible, responsive and green in every sweep
  above, but they are not built from the shared components. Migrating a working
  screen is a change with risk and no user-visible benefit, so it is listed
  rather than done. **Seven legacy views.**

# D17 — the permanent documentation rule, and the reconciliation it forced   (2026-09-01)

**Owner decision. Documentation only — no application code, database, API,
routing or UI changed by this entry.**

## The decision

The owner made documentation a permanent, binding rule rather than a habit:
every phase, sub-phase, bug fix, architectural decision, security finding, UI
migration, database migration, deployment change, environment change, test
milestone, owner decision, important limitation and backlog reclassification is
recorded, and the repository must be sufficient for an agent with **zero chat
history** to understand the project A → Z.

Recorded as **D17** in [11-MASTER-PLAN.md](11-MASTER-PLAN.md) §1. It **extends
D10** — which bound only this file — to the whole documentation set. **D10 is
not superseded and is unchanged.**

Three sub-rules are absolute and are the ones that will bite:

- **(a) Evidence is labelled, never inflated.** OBSERVED / TESTED / REHEARSED /
  INFERRED / PLANNED / BLOCKED / UNTESTED are different words. A gate that was
  not run is written `NOT RUN`, never converted to PASS. Test totals are read
  off an actual run, never remembered.
- **(b) Drift is disclosed, never hidden.** Where the deployed system differs
  from the blueprint, both are stated, with the reason and the security
  implication, until the blueprint is reconciled.
- **(c) Accuracy outranks completeness.** NOT BUILT, PARTIAL, BLOCKED and
  EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY are acceptable answers. Making a row look finished is
  not.

## Why the rule was needed, in this project's own evidence

Two failures already on record, and they are the same failure:

- A decision recorded as *"rebuild the app on the Ata Ekta design system"*
  (`c93bddc`) had changed **1 view module of 59**. Nobody could tell for
  months, because the document asserted the outcome and nothing checked it.
  That is what D14 and the UI/UX audit of 2026-09-01 exist to correct.
- The TypeScript gate stayed **red across six commits** because its result was
  assumed rather than read.

Both are a claim in a document that no longer matched the repository. The
remedy is not more documentation; it is documentation that is *falsifiable and
checked*, which is why (a) and (c) matter more than volume.

## First act under D17: P4's missing commit hash

P4's entry above was written before the commit existed, so it recorded every
gate and no hash. **P4 is commit `95c34bf`**, pushed to `origin/main`
(`f62b8db..95c34bf`). D17 requires the hash on every phase entry; this is that
correction, made by appending rather than by editing the P4 entry.

## Second act: a reconciliation, and what it found

Documentation was audited against D17 §17's twenty-two handoff questions and
§20's pre-commit checklist. **Six defects**, all of them the kind that reads as
correct until somebody checks.

### 1. `07-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` §1 was three weeks and four phases stale

It was dated **2026-08-11** and described Vercel, Neon, **890 tests**, **45
migrations** and **four** surfaces — while P2, P3, P3.1 and P4 sat appended to
the bottom of the same file. A reader who trusted §1 would have believed the
product had roughly two-thirds of the tests it has, on hosting it no longer
uses.

Reconciled to measured values: **1,352 tests** (run twice, DB-backed),
**48 migrations**, **227 RLS policies / 110 RLS-enabled tables / 108 with
`tenant_id`** (queried, not remembered), **five** surfaces, P0–P4 complete.
The superseded figures are not deleted from the project — each is in this file
under the phase that produced it, which is where D17 says they belong.

### 2. The architecture drift was real and undisclosed

`D1` says Neon Postgres. `06-DEPLOYMENT.md` is *titled* "Deployment: Neon
Postgres". Production has run on a **Hostinger VPS with Caddy and a
`pgvector/pgvector:pg16` Docker container** since 2026-08-31. The deployment
itself was recorded here at the time — but no document reconciled the two, so
both stories were live and a reader could pick either.

Now disclosed in **[11-MASTER-PLAN.md §5b](11-MASTER-PLAN.md)** with the
reasons and, as D17(b) requires, the **security implications in both
directions**: isolation is *better* (a dedicated container on loopback, no new
superuser on the box holding five sibling applications, the no-`BYPASSRLS`
rule asserted at boot, and 0 tenants visible without tenant context verified on
production); availability is *worse* (one box, one process, no regional
failover, and a shared Caddy whose misconfiguration would take down five other
products). That risk is carried knowingly at a pre-pilot stage.

**The blueprint documents are deliberately NOT rewritten.** Making them say
"VPS" would tell a future reader the blueprint was always the VPS, which is
false, and would erase the reasoning. Which architecture is the *target* is an
owner decision, tracked as **`B-27`**.

### 3. `07` contradicted itself about two shipped features

§1 listed the audit viewer and guardian links among R-3's delivered portals.
§9e, further down the same file, still said **"No audit viewer — backend
complete, UI pending"** and **"Guardian management is read-only"**. Checked
against the code: `audit-view.ts` exists and `audit` is in the navigation for
principal and IT admin; `guardian-panel.ts` posts a new link and patches
`canPayFees`. Both bullets were closed by R-3's own completion pass and had
survived for three days.

Struck through in place with a dated resolution rather than deleted — a reader
who meets the old claim in another document needs to see how it ended. Kept as
`B-24` and `B-25`. Guardian **unlinking** genuinely is still missing and is now
`B-7`.

### 4. Three Vercel artefacts still read as current instructions

The API base URL, the demo address (`?demo=1`, superseded by `/demo` in P1),
and a smoke test pinned to a Vercel edge IP that no longer means anything.
Corrected, each with the superseded form named so it stays recognisable.

### 5. The README — the first thing anybody reads — was the worst of them

"Live at `https://shikhon-lms.vercel.app`", and a status line claiming
**15 migrations, 88 tables, 103 RLS policies**. The real numbers are 48 and
227/110/108. A `START HERE` banner now routes to the handoff document and
states the current architecture, with the drift named rather than smoothed
over.

### 6. There was no single backlog

The same items were scattered across a "classified but NOT implemented" table
here, limitation bullets in `07`, severity rules in the audit plan, and a
`R-5: object storage · CSV export · …` line that had been copy-pasted forward
through five phases. [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) is now the only one: **29 items**
with permanent IDs, in D17's six categories, each citing where it came from.
Nothing was invented for it.

## Documents added

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`docs/00-START-HERE.md`](00-START-HERE.md) | The zero-context handoff. Answers D17 §17's twenty-two questions, with the honest "not built" / "not observed" answers intact, and routes to everything else |
| [`docs/BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) | The single backlog — 29 IDs, six categories, every row sourced |

## Documents changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `11-MASTER-PLAN.md` | **D17** added to the decisions of record · **§5a** phase status board in D17's vocabulary (R-0…R-9 and P0…P8) · **§5b** architecture drift disclosed |
| `07-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` | §1 reconciled to measured current values · three Vercel artefacts corrected · two superseded limitation bullets struck through with dated resolutions |
| `README.md` | START HERE banner · deployment section corrected · database numbers corrected |
| `UI-UX-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md` | Currency stamp (P0–P4 delivered, P5–P8 not started) · duplicate `## 21` heading fixed |
| `FINAL-PRODUCT-SURFACE-ARCHITECTURE.md` | Currency stamp with the **delivery state of each of the five surfaces** — two of the preferred doors (`<slug>.` and `platform.`) are specified and **NOT ENABLED** · finding 2 marked resolved by P1 |
| `PHASE_LOG.md` | This entry |

## What this entry deliberately does not claim

- **No verification ran against production.** Every production figure repeated
  here is quoted from the R-8 deployment entry of 2026-08-31, not re-observed.
  That the box has not been redeployed since is **INFERRED** from the absence
  of a later entry.
- **Whether login is enabled in production is NOT OBSERVED.** R-8 made it an
  environment switch defaulting off; its live value is a property of
  `/etc/shikhon/shikhon.env` and cannot be read from this repository.
- **No stale document was made to look correct.** `06-DEPLOYMENT.md` and
  `12-PRODUCTION-RUNBOOK.md` still describe Neon, and still say so.

## Gate

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Full suite | **1,352 passing**, 12 workspaces — unchanged, documentation-only |

**Next phase: P5 — Principal + IT Admin.** It opens with `B-8` (what
`doLogout` does about the read-through caches, given the outbox may hold
unsent attendance) and `B-15` (a section-scoped routine endpoint).

## Commit, and the convention for recording it

**This entry is commit `59b06ca`** (`95c34bf..59b06ca`, pushed to
`origin/main`).

D17 requires a commit hash on every entry, and an entry is always written
*before* the commit that carries it — P4's entry hit this first and went in
without one. The convention, so nobody has to solve it again: **write the
entry without the hash, commit, then append the hash in a one-line follow-up
like this one.** The alternative — amending the commit — would rewrite
history to make the record look tidy, which is the one thing D10 forbids.

# Pre-P5 Product Closure Pass   (2026-09-01)

Five items, four of them closed and one deferred on evidence. P5 has not
started, no Principal or IT Admin screen was redesigned, and no D16 commercial
control was built.

---

## B-8 — logout, cache privacy, and the outbox

### The audit, before any code

Four kinds of local state, and they had never been distinguished:

| Tier | Where | On logout |
|---|---|---|
| 1 · session | `shikhon_auth`, `shikhon_otp_login` | **cleared** — it *is* the logout |
| 2 · screen cache | ~20 `shikhon_*` keys + the service worker's Cache API | **cleared** — this is the tier that leaks |
| 3 · **outbox** | IndexedDB `shikhon` (attendance and marks authored offline) | **NEVER cleared, by anything** |
| 4 · device | `shikhon_d`, `shikhon_tid`, `shikhon_branding_*`, theme, rail, text size | kept |

Tier 4 is kept for reasons, not by omission: dropping `shikhon_d` mints a new
device id on every sign-out and churns the push and sync registrations keyed
to it, and dropping `shikhon_tid` returns a school to a generic login screen,
which D12 exists to prevent.

`apps/pwa/src/local-data.ts` holds the classification, once, for both callers.
It is a **keep-list**, not a delete-list: tier 2 is one key per screen and a
delete-list is a list somebody forgets to extend — where the cost of
forgetting is a privacy leak that looks like a cache hit.

### The question the brief did not ask, which keeping the outbox forces

If the outbox survives a logout, then on a shared device it contains work
belonging to somebody who is not signed in. What does the new session do
with it?

Before this pass: **sent it, under the new person's token.** `drain()` claimed
every pending op and posted it with the current credentials. The server's
`TENANT_MISMATCH` guard would not fire — same school — and `appliers.ts`
writes `op.actorId` as `taken_by`, so teacher A's register would be applied
inside teacher B's RLS context: succeeding if B happens to teach that section,
and parked as **`failed`** if he does not. That last outcome is the permanent
loss the outbox exists to prevent.

The fix needed no new concept. `OutboxOp` has carried `tenantId` and `actorId`
since this package was written, and `SyncEngine` is constructed with both. A
session now flushes **its own** ops; anybody else's stay pending, untouched,
and drain when their author signs in on that device again — which is what
"preserved" has to mean if it means anything.

Filtered **inside the cursor**, beside the backoff test, not after the batch.
Filtering the result would let 25 of somebody else's ops starve this session's
out of every round, permanently and silently. There is a test for exactly that.

The unsent badge is owner-scoped for the same reason: "৩টি অপেক্ষমাণ" for work
the person reading it did not do is a support call, not a status.

### A race, found in a browser and not by any test

Driving guardian → student through the picker: `shikhon_guardian_home` was
gone afterwards and `shikhon_invoices_cache` was **not**. Both are tier 2 and
both were swept.

The sweep was correct; its **position** was not. It ran first and then awaited
the Cache API — and that await gives a resolved `authedFetch` a turn. The fee
screen was the last one open, its request was still in flight, and its entire
job on resolving is to write what it received into its cache. It re-cached
itself into an already-emptied store.

Now: caches first, `localStorage` last, and `sweepNow()` — the synchronous
half — runs in the same block as the reload, with no await between them, so
nothing can interleave.

### Verified in a browser, all three transitions

| Transition | `shikhon_` keys before | after | previous role's data on any screen |
|---|---|---|---|
| teacher → student | 13 | 4 | none |
| teacher → guardian | 10 | 4 | none |
| guardian → student | 8 | 4 | none |

The four survivors are `shikhon_d`, `shikhon_tid`-equivalent demo selectors and
`shikhon_branding_*` — tier 4, exactly as designed.

**Honest scope of that evidence:** this is the demo's role picker, because
production login is disabled and a real logout→login cycle cannot be driven
here. Both paths call the same `purgeLocalData`, one parameter apart, and a
test asserts that the two reasons differ in exactly one tier. The *logout*
path's behaviour is TESTED, not OBSERVED.

---

## B-15 — a student's own routine

### The schema, read before anything was added

`app.teacher_day` answers "which periods is this PERSON responsible for", in
both directions, and returns three facts a student must never read:
`student_count`, `attendance_taken`, `delivery_logged`. Widening it would mean
leaking those or branching on role inside a function RLS policies depend on.

So: `app.student_day(p_student, p_date)`, **migration 049**, a sibling keyed on
the SECTION. And an index for it was not needed — migration 011 created
`ix_slots_section_day` with the comment *"Section day view (student/guardian
'today's classes')"* and nothing had ever called it.

### Three things a naive section lookup gets wrong

1. **Parallel blocks.** Migration 034's `parallel_pool` puts two religion
   variants in the same section at the same hour. A student attends one.
   Filtered through `student_subjects` (025), so the Hindu student is not shown
   an Islamic-studies period on their own timetable — not a leak of anyone
   else's data, but fabricated curriculum for them, which §10 forbids.
2. **The academic year.** Resolved by the year that CONTAINS the date, not the
   one flagged current, so a date in last year answers with last year's section.
3. **Substitutions.** A section's day never loses the period; it changes who
   takes it. Resolved to the covering teacher, flagged.

### SECURITY DEFINER, and why the first draft was wrong

The first version was invoker-rights like `teacher_day`. Running it produced
`teacher_name_bn: null` on every period and `is_substitution: false` on a
covered one — because under a student's session `SELECT count(*) FROM users`
returns **1**. Migration 010 shows a student themselves and their household
and nothing else, correctly, and that is not changing for a timetable.

Definer-rights, with the safety moved from "RLS will catch it" to "there is
nothing to catch": `app.can_see_student` gates every row, **every** join
carries an explicit `tenant_id = app.current_tenant()` including the lookups
invoker rights would have covered for free, and exactly one column is taken
from `users` — `full_name_bn`. What that widens, stated plainly: a student
learns the display name of the teacher taking a period on their own timetable.
That is a person standing at the front of their classroom.

### Authorization, tested against a database

`GET /api/v1/academics/myroutine`, 18 tests, two tenants, twice:

- a student reads their own day; **a classmate's returns nothing**
- a guardian reads their own child; another family's child returns nothing
- a teacher scoped to no section reads nothing, even for a slot they teach
- another tenant's principal, given a valid uuid, gets nothing
- **the refusal is silent**: a forbidden id and a nonexistent id return
  byte-identical answers, so the endpoint is not an id oracle
- a student naming a classmate is refused 403 **and the id is not echoed back**
- teacher-only fields are asserted absent from the response

### Two defects the browser found and no test would have

- **"২ম পিরিয়ড".** Bangla ordinals are per-number — ১ম ২য় ৩য় ৪র্থ ৫ম ৬ষ্ঠ —
  and only 1, 5, 7 and 8 take ম. The bug is invisible in a screenshot of
  period one. A student would read it the way an English speaker reads "2th".
- **A covered period that was also the current one silently stopped saying it
  was covered**, because badge precedence gave the one slot to "এখন চলছে".
  Timing and identity are different facts; the substitution moved to the meta
  line beside the name it qualifies — "শাহনাজ পারভীন (বদলি)" — where it
  answers "who" and "is this the usual teacher" in one read.

---

## B-6 — class and section edit

**Implemented.** The audit found the gap was never in the database: migration
042 has allowed UPDATE on `classes` and `sections` for principal,
school_owner, academic_coordinator and it_admin since R-3. What was missing
was the distance between that policy and a person — `structure.ts` handled GET
and a create-POST and nothing else, so a section typed "কক" instead of "ক"
needed SQL, which the pilot runbook calls a blocker.

`PATCH /api/v1/ops/structure` corrects a NAME. It deliberately refuses
everything that re-bases records underneath it:

| Editable | Refused | Because |
|---|---|---|
| class `name_bn`, `name_en`, `display_order` | `level_no`, `stream`, `group` | they decide which subject template the class draws from; every enrolment and mark below was derived on that basis |
| section `name`, `capacity` | `class_id`, `academic_year_id` | moving a section moves every child in it without one enrolment row changing |

A capacity below the children already enrolled is refused with the real
number, because the enrolment cap reads that column and accepting it silently
breaks admission the next morning.

The UI is a drawer built from P2 components, opened from the section detail
screen and per class-group on the level screen — a level is a level *number*
and `classes` rows hang off its groups, so নবম বিজ্ঞান and নবম ব্যবসায় are two
records, not one. 12 DB tests, run twice. Verified in a browser including the
refusal path, dialog semantics, focus containment and both themes.

## B-7 — guardian unlink: **DEFERRED**, and here is the exact constraint

The brief asked why it was blocked. It was blocked **on purpose**, and
migration 042 says so in its own words:

> Unlinking a guardian removes the record that they were ever responsible.
> The office marks a link inactive by moving `is_primary` and the permissions,
> which keeps the row; a genuine data-entry error is rare enough to be worth a
> support request rather than a delete button on a family relationship.

`guardianship_delete_scope ... USING (false)` — DELETE is denied to
`shikhon_app` for every role, at the database.

**The constraint, precisely.** `guardianships` has no `ended_on`, `revoked_at`
or `is_active` column. So the model cannot express "this link ended", and
there are exactly two ways forward:

1. a hard DELETE — forbidden by design, and by the brief's "do not force a
   destructive implementation";
2. a soft-end column, which is a schema change with a wider blast radius than
   it first appears.

**Sized honestly.** `guardianships` is read at **21 sites across 11 files**,
including `sms-svc/dispatch.ts` and `ops-svc/api/notices.ts`. A revoke that
misses one of those keeps sending a stranger the child's absence texts — a
privacy failure that no existing test would catch, because every existing test
asserts the guardian *does* receive them. It also needs:

- `UNIQUE (tenant_id, student_id, guardian_id)` made partial, or a revoked
  link can never be re-created;
- `uq_guardianship_primary` made partial for the same reason;
- `app.my_ward_ids()` and therefore `app.can_see_student()` — read by RLS
  policies across the schema — changed.

**Why that is not this pass's work.** The change can only ever *narrow*
access, which makes it safer than it looks; but it touches the two helper
functions every guardian-facing policy in the product depends on, and it
requires a decision about the SMS and notice pipelines that is a product
decision, not a refactor. The brief's own rule applies: *"If the current data
model cannot safely support it, leave it deferred and document the exact
constraint."*

**Recorded as `B-7`, priority HIGH, owner P5**, with the design above so P5
implements it rather than re-deriving it. It remains the
highest-consequence open item in the backlog: a guardian linked to the wrong
child is a live privacy incident that currently ends only with SQL.

---

## §5 — one permission sentence

`humanError()` has had the right words since P2 — "এই কাজটি করার অনুমতি আপনার
নেই।" — and only the attendance screen passed it the HTTP status. Everywhere
else threw it away:

    roster-view    catch { errorMsg = 'সেকশনের তালিকা আনা যায়নি।' }
    marks-view     same shape
    guardian-view  humanError(onLine ? null : 'offline')   — no status

So a guardian who reached a teacher's URL was told the fetch failed: wrong,
and offering a retry that cannot work. Two messages for one condition is worse
than either alone, because a support call gets a different answer depending on
which screen the caller was looking at.

Fixed by carrying the status rather than by adding a string — `HttpStatus`
instead of `new Error(String(status))` — and by one further rule that matters
more than the wording: **a 403 is not an offline state.** The affected screens
now discard their cache on a refusal instead of showing it under "সর্বশেষ
সংরক্ষিত", which had been saying the opposite of what the server said.

Browser-verified as a guardian: roster and attendance both now say the
permission sentence; nothing says "আনা যায়নি".

---

## Two more demo gates, and a test that was too narrow

P4 built a test that DERIVES the demo's staff-only list from the services so
it cannot drift. It covered `requireStaff` and nothing else — and this pass,
driving the demo as a **student**, opened `#/guardian` and read two children's
names, sections, roll numbers, attendance, fees and results.

`/academics/ward` is not staff-only; it is `requireRole(WARD_ROLES)`, which
excludes students. A different gate, the same hole, and a green test.

The derivation now covers every `requireRole(claims, X)` on a GET, resolving
`X` to its role list. That found three more the demo answered to anyone:
`/academics/classperf`, `/academics/subjectchoice` and `/rms/editor`. All four
are gated now with the service's own role lists.

Two false positives in the widened detector were fixed rather than silenced:
`ops/calendar` answers its GET and returns *before* the guard (its read is
deliberately open to every role — "a guardian planning around ঈদের ছুটি is the
whole point of publishing one"), and `/rms/examroutine` and `/rms/generation`
have no demo route at all, so they 404, which is a stricter refusal than a
gate.

---

## A correction to this project's own record

**`tsc -p .` does not typecheck `apps/pwa`.** The root `tsconfig.json`
excludes it, and CI runs **three** configs:

```
tsconfig.json · apps/pwa/tsconfig.json · apps/pwa/tsconfig.sw.json
```

P4's and D17's gate tables record "TypeScript ×3 — 0 errors". That meant three
*runs of one config*. The PWA — the surface P0–P4 built — was never
typechecked by me in either pass. Running the right three here found nine
errors, all in code written minutes earlier in this pass, so the app config was
clean before it; but the claim was broader than the evidence, which is exactly
the failure D17(a) exists to prevent. All three are green now and all three are
in this pass's gate table.

## B-31 — the typecheck gate now matches CI, and cannot silently drift

### What the audit found

CI runs **three** configs, all in `.github/workflows/security.yml`:

```
tsc -p tsconfig.json               --noEmit
tsc -p apps/pwa/tsconfig.json      --noEmit
tsc -p apps/pwa/tsconfig.sw.json   --noEmit
```

The other four workflows (`database`, `frontend`, `offline`, `sync-svc`) run
no compiler at all. So the CI scope is exactly those three — and the root
config **excludes `apps/pwa`**, which is why `tsc -p .` exits 0 without
looking at a single line of the application.

### The measurement nobody had taken

Running all three with `--listFiles` and subtracting from the repo's `.ts`
files:

| | files |
|---|---|
| repo `.ts` (tracked + untracked, `.gitignore` honoured) | 295 |
| checked by at least one CI config | **235** |
| **checked by nothing** | **60** |

The 60 are 34 `apps/pwa/test`, 7 `packages/ui-core/test`, 3
`services/sync-svc/test`, 2 `packages/offline/test` — and 14
`apps/pwa/public/design/components/**`, which is the Ata Ekta prototype and
is outside the product by D14.

So **46 test files are typechecked by nothing**, including the 592 that guard
the application. That is not fixed here and the reason is measured, not
assumed: adding `apps/pwa/test` to the PWA config produces **73 errors** —
mostly a missing `@types/jsdom`, plus real looseness in test code. That is its
own piece of work, and the brief for this gate said not to modify tsconfig for
convenience. Recorded as **`B-32`**.

### What was built instead

`scripts/typecheck.mjs`, run by `npm run typecheck`, and it does two things:

**1. It reads the workflow to find out what to run.** It does not hold its own
list of configs — it parses `tsc -p <config> --noEmit` out of
`security.yml`. A config added to CI is picked up here with no edit; one
removed stops being run. The two cannot disagree because there is one list and
CI owns it. If the parse ever finds zero configs it exits 1 rather than
reporting a pass, which is the same trap the workflow's own `--no-install`
comment describes.

**2. It freezes the coverage hole.** The union of `--listFiles` is subtracted
from the repo's `.ts` files and compared against
`scripts/typecheck-baseline.json`. **A new file that no config checks fails the
gate.** Re-baselining is possible and deliberate (`--update`).

Verified in all three directions, by doing them:

| | result |
|---|---|
| clean tree | passes, reports 236/297 |
| a new `.ts` outside every config | **FAILS** — named the file |
| a real type error in a covered file | **FAILS** — printed the error |

It caught its own author within the hour: `apps/pwa/test/permission-ux.test.ts`,
written for B-30 below, failed the gate as a new unchecked file and had to be
re-baselined on purpose.

Two implementation notes worth keeping. `git ls-files '*.ts'` lists only
TRACKED files, so the first version passed a brand-new module until somebody
staged it — precisely backwards, since the gate is most useful while the file
is being written; it uses `--cached --others --exclude-standard` now. And it
invokes `node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc` rather than `npx`: Node refuses
to `execFileSync` a `.cmd` on Windows without a shell (EINVAL), and a shell
would concatenate arguments unescaped through a repository path containing a
space. Calling the local compiler directly IS what `--no-install` guarantees.

CI gained one step (`node scripts/typecheck.mjs`) so the drift assertion runs
there too. The three declared lines are unchanged — they are the contract the
script parses.

### Documentation corrected

P4's, D17's and the closure pass's gate tables said "TypeScript ×3". That meant
three *runs of one config*. The rows now name the three configs. The claim was
broader than the evidence, which is what D17(a) exists to prevent.

---

## B-30 — a 403 is not an outage, on nine student-facing screens

### The audit, wider than the backlog entry

The backlog named four screens. Searching every student-accessible view found
the same shape in **nine**:

```ts
if (!res.ok) throw new Error(String(res.status));
…
} catch { this.offline = this.data.length > 0; }
```

The status is turned into a string and then dropped by a bare `catch`, so a
refusal and a dead network arrive at the same place. Three consequences, and
they are not equally bad:

1. the wrong sentence — "আনা যায়নি";
2. a retry offered that can never succeed;
3. **the data the server just refused stays on screen**, out of a cache filled
   while this person was allowed to see it, or by somebody else on a shared
   device. That one is a privacy failure, not a usability one.

And the wording itself had **five variants** for one condition:
`humanError`'s generic line, `permissionState`'s different generic line, and
three bespoke strings in `documents-view` (×2) and `calendar-view`. A support
call got a different answer depending on which screen the caller was on.

### The pattern

One function, `permissionMessage(subject?)`:

| call | result |
|---|---|
| `permissionMessage()` | এই কাজটি করার অনুমতি আপনার নেই। |
| `permissionMessage('শিক্ষাপঞ্জি')` | শিক্ষাপঞ্জি দেখার অনুমতি আপনার নেই। |

The **subject is kept**, deliberately. It was the good part of the bespoke
strings — it tells a person what they cannot see. What is unified is the shape
and the ending. `humanError(code, status, subject?)` and `permissionState()`
both route through it, so there is now one definition and no way to add a
sixth by accident.

`apps/pwa/src/http-status.ts` carries the status through the throw
(`refuseUnlessOk` / `isDenied`), replacing three identical copies of
`class HttpStatus` that the closure pass had left in three files. 401 is
deliberately not a denial: a dead session is recoverable by signing in again.

### What each screen does now on a 403

- shows the canonical sentence with its own subject and who to ask;
- **drops the cache** — from the DOM and from `localStorage`;
- does not say "offline" and offers no retry.

`permissionState()` — the P2 component built for exactly this and reachable
from none of these screens — renders it, and it is placed *above* the offline
banner, the skeleton and the empty state, because it outranks all three.

### The finding that reframes the item

**A 403 is not currently reachable on six of the nine.** `academics/subjects`,
`attendance`, `results`, `assignments`, `chapters` and `finance/invoices` are
not role-gated at all: they authenticate and let RLS scope the answer, so a
reader who should not see a row gets an **empty payload, not a refusal**.
`finance/invoices` says so in its own header — "guardians/students are scoped
by RLS `invoice_scope`, so `authenticate()` alone is the right gate."

So on those six the handling is **defensive**: correct, tested, and waiting for
a caller that can produce a 403 — a future gate, a proxy, a permission changed
mid-session, or `/academics/myroutine`, which the closure pass added and which
*does* refuse a student naming a classmate. That is stated rather than dressed
up as a fix for a live bug.

The three where a 403 IS reachable — `academic`, `documents`, `guardian` — are
browser-verified below.

### A defect the browser found after the code was "done"

As a student, `#/guardian` showed the canonical sentence **and still offered
"আবার চেষ্টা করুন"**. The message had been fixed and the button had not:
`errorState`'s whole shape is a sentence plus a retry. A 403 now gets
`permissionState` there instead. Verified after: canonical sentence, lock
state, no retry.

### Tests

`apps/pwa/test/permission-ux.test.ts` — 23 tests. Four screens driven through
five cases each, plus the pattern itself. The two that matter most:

- **the cache is gone** from the DOM *and* from `localStorage` after a 403;
- **an ordinary network failure still shows the cache under a banner.** A fix
  that turned every error into a lockout would pass every other assertion here
  and ruin an offline-first product.

`calendar-ui.test.ts`'s 403 assertion was re-pointed from a substring of the
old bespoke wording to `permissionMessage('শিক্ষাপঞ্জি')` — the same claim,
pinned to the function every screen now shares.

---

## A blind spot found in P4's own demo-gate test

The derivation skips `index.ts`, on the assumption that it is a dispatcher.
`finance-svc` and `identity-svc` put real handlers in theirs, so a role gate
added there would be invisible to it.

Checked by hand: there is **no gap today**. `/finance/invoices` is deliberately
ungated, `/finance/generate` is POST-only and already in `DEMO_GATES`, and
`/finance/ledger` has no demo route so it 404s. Automating it needs the
`ROUTES` table parsed to map handler names to path segments. Recorded as
**`B-33`** with that note in the test itself.

## B-7 — a guardianship can end, without ever being deleted

### The audit, before any code

Migration 042 refused DELETE on `guardianships` deliberately, and its own
comment gives the reason: a family relationship is a record, and the receipts,
attendance rows and audit entries covering that period must stay readable.
That reasoning is right and is not reversed.

What it did not provide is the thing it assumed existed — a way to say the
relationship **ended**. `is_primary` and `receives_sms` are permissions
*within* a relationship; turning them off left a former guardian still reading
a child's attendance, results and fees, because `app.my_ward_ids()` asks only
whether the row exists.

### The dangerous part, and the shape of the fix

`guardianships` is read at **twelve** places. Eleven would have kept working
after a revocation, and the worst of them is `sms-svc/dispatch.ts`: a missed
filter there texts a former guardian about a child every time that child is
marked absent.

Eleven hand-edits is a list somebody forgets. So the filter went where it
cannot be forgotten — a RESTRICTIVE SELECT policy that makes revoked rows
**invisible**:

```sql
CREATE POLICY guardianship_hide_revoked ON guardianships
  AS RESTRICTIVE FOR SELECT TO shikhon_app
  USING (revoked_at IS NULL
         OR app.has_role('principal','school_owner','it_admin'));
```

Every one of those eleven queries runs as `shikhon_app` — including the
dispatcher, under its `system_ingest` role — so all eleven are corrected and
**not one of them changed a character**. Management is exempt because the
office must be able to see that a link ended and when. `app.has_role` reads a
GUC and touches no table, so this cannot recurse through `users_scope`.

Three readers a policy cannot reach, because they are SECURITY DEFINER or a
different database role. There are exactly three, and all three are rewritten
in migration 050: `app.my_ward_ids`, `app.resolve_notice_audience` (both
guardian branches — the payers one and the general one) and
`app.tenant_onboarding_state`.

### The rest of the design

- `revoked_at` / `revoked_by` / `revoked_reason`, **all three or none**. A
  revocation with no actor is an audit gap; one with no reason is
  indistinguishable from a bug.
- **Both unique constraints become partial.** Without that a revoked link
  could never be re-created — and the commonest reason to revoke is a typo
  whose fix is to link the right person. The primary-guardian index had the
  same problem in a worse form: a student whose primary guardian was revoked
  could never be given another.
- `app.revoke_guardianship()` is SECURITY INVOKER, so RLS decides who may
  write, exactly as 042's `set_guardian_permissions` does.
- **It refuses to remove the last contactable guardian** of a student with no
  phone or email of their own. Migration 031 will not CREATE a child in that
  state; revocation was the back door into it, because that trigger fires on
  `users` and not on this table.

### What the UI says

"**সম্পর্ক শেষ করুন**", not "মুছে ফেলুন". The label is the design: nothing is
deleted, and a delete button on a family relationship would promise otherwise.
The confirmation carries the required reason field in the same step — a yes/no
followed by a 400 the person cannot act on is an obstacle, not a confirmation.
Consequences first, reassurance last, because the office's first fear is that
they are destroying a record.

### A defect found on the way, worse than the one it hid

`writeAudit`'s documented contract is "never throws", implemented as a bare
`catch`. **Inside a transaction that is a trap, not a safety net.** PostgreSQL
aborts the whole transaction on any statement error, so swallowing the
exception leaves the caller running in a poisoned transaction whose COMMIT
silently becomes a ROLLBACK.

The revocation endpoint passed `${studentId}:${guardianId}` into `entity_id`,
which is a `uuid` column. The result: **HTTP 200, carrying a real timestamp,
for a revocation that had not happened.** Nothing logged an error. Every
`writeAudit` call site in this repository had the same exposure.

`writeAudit` now brackets its insert in a SAVEPOINT, so a failed audit rolls
back only itself. The audit row is lost — the documented trade-off — and the
operation is not, which was always the intent. Four tests hold it, including
that two audits in one transaction do not share a savepoint name.

### Tests

`services/ops-svc/test/b7-guardian-revoke.test.ts`, 16 tests, twice. The two
that carry the weight are named as such: **the former guardian stops reading
the child** (`app.my_ward_ids()` returns `[]`, which is what
`can_see_student` asks and therefore what every guardian-facing RLS policy
asks), and **the absence SMS stops going to them** — asserted by running the
dispatcher's exact query under the dispatcher's exact role.

Also asserted: the row still exists, the relation is unchanged, the office can
still see it, the same guardian can be re-linked, the audit entry names people
rather than uuids, a class teacher cannot, a guardian cannot unlink
themselves, another school's principal gets 404 rather than 403, and a child
is never left with no contactable adult.

---

## The Principal dashboard

`apps/pwa/src/principal-home-view.ts`, on the P2 components. **No API change
was needed**: `GET /ops/dashboard` already returned every field the brief asks
for, so this was a UI job on a complete endpoint.

### Ordered by the three questions the brief asks

1. **What needs attention** — the pending queue, and only its non-zero rows.
   An empty queue is one calm line ("সব কিছু নির্ধারিত আছে"), not four ০s: a
   row of zeroes is a wall a person reads to learn nothing.
2. **What changed** — today's attendance and today's absences, the only
   figures on the screen that differ from yesterday's.
3. **What can be acted on** — exams, notices, the fee position.
4. Standing counts last, because they are the same as yesterday.

### Carried over from R-3, because they were right

- **`percent: null` is "nobody has taken attendance yet", not 0%.** A
  dashboard reading ০% at 8:05 puts a head teacher on the phone to a class
  teacher who has done nothing wrong.
- **The fee block is absent, not hidden.** `finance` is null in the response
  for a coordinator; there is no CSS doing the hiding, because a hidden card
  with the numbers still in the body is the pattern D13 rules out.

### Genuinely desktop, genuinely mobile

`.ph-cols` stacks on a phone and becomes 2 columns at 1024 and 3 at 1440. The
responsive block sits at the END of `app.css` on purpose — those overrides are
equal in specificity to the base rules, so source order decides, and P1 spent a
day on a school name that rendered twice because a hide rule sat 1,700 lines
above the thing it hid.

### Two defects the browser found

- **`.ui-stat-row` was hard-coded to `repeat(4, 1fr)` at desktop.** Right for a
  row of four and wrong for every other count: this screen's "today" band and
  the guardian home both carry TWO cards, and at 1440 they rendered at a
  quarter width each with half the row empty — a P4 regression nobody had
  looked at on a wide screen. Now `auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)`.
- **"undefinedটি ইনভয়েস বাকি".** The first draft invented `collectedThisMonth`
  and `invoicesDue`; the endpoint returns `{invoiced, collected, outstanding,
  unpaidCount}` summed over the ACADEMIC YEAR. Both the field names and the
  label were wrong, and the label being wrong is the worse of the two — "এ
  মাসে আদায়" over a year's total is a wrong number dressed as a right one.

### Tests and browser

13 tests, asserting mostly about **order and absence**: the queue leads, a zero
is not a task, `null` is not 0%, the fee block does not exist for a role
without it, no charts, and no platform or subscription wording anywhere near
school tuition (D16).

Browser: **1024 / 1440 / 1600 / 390 / 360 × light + dark**, tenant A and B.
96 element-checks per desktop configuration, 68 per mobile — **0 contrast
failures, 0 overflow, 0 unnamed controls, 0 `undefined` in accessible text**
after the two fixes above.

---

## What P5 has NOT done

Stated plainly, because the completion gate says a phase is complete only when
its whole scope is:

- **The IT Admin screens are not started.** Academic structure, users,
  teachers, students, guardians, imports, branding, settings, audit and system
  health all keep their pre-P2 markup.
- **The Principal's other screens are not restyled.** Only the dashboard.
  `academic`, `students`, `publish`, `calendar`, `documents`, `audit` and the
  settings screens are unchanged.
- **The audit viewer UX** (actor, filters, changed fields, permission-aware
  redaction) is not built beyond what R-3 shipped.
- **No browser acceptance across the full P5 matrix** — only the dashboard and
  the guardian-unlink flow were driven.

`B-7` is **RESOLVED**. The dashboard is one screen of P5's scope.

# P5 / B-34 — the IT Admin and Principal surfaces   (2026-09-01) · **PARTIAL**

Continues P5. Three real defects found and fixed, two structural migrations
done, and a meaningful part of B-34 deliberately not attempted — see the end.

---

## The audit that changed the plan

The obvious reading of B-34 was "rewrite ~7,000 lines of legacy view code onto
P2". Measuring first said otherwise, twice.

**The look was already canonical.** `.card` and `.ui-card` differ only in a
padding declaration and a token alias — P0 converged them when it re-pointed
the palette. So a "migration" that rewrote fourteen files to change nothing
visible would have been fourteen chances to break working screens.

**The real gap was shape, not style.** Rendered at 1440, `users-view` was six
`.system-row` stacked rows across a 1142px content column, and at 375 the same
rows with no overflow. The MOBILE shape was already right; the DESKTOP one was
a phone layout stretched, which is exactly what §4 forbids. That is what P2's
`dataTable` fixes — one column definition, a table for a desktop and a
MobileList for a phone — and no amount of CSS convergence would have.

So the work went where the gap was.

## Migrated to `dataTable`

| Screen | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `users-view` | stacked rows at every width | table at desktop · list on a phone |
| `students-view` | stacked rows at every width | table at desktop · list on a phone |

Both keep every rule they had. `canManage` still gates the actions and the
action column simply does not exist without it; an activation code is still
offered only to an account that can still sign in; the deactivation
confirmation keeps its wording. Both show the school's own code — `T-101`,
the permanent student id — and never a uuid.

**`audit-view` was deliberately NOT migrated to `dataTable`**, and that is an
exception with a reason rather than an omission: the value of an audit row IS
its before/after diff, and a table cell cannot hold a two-column diff. It keeps
its disclosure list and gains a desktop column rhythm (`au-rows`) so a 1440px
screen scans like a table while each row still opens beneath.

## Three defects, all found by rendering the thing

### 1. A raw uuid on every expanded audit entry

`শনাক্তকারী: 7b06d000-0000-4000-8000-…`. §14 forbids a uuid in visible or
accessible text, and it was never usable: a school office cannot read one down
a phone, cannot search by it, and cannot do anything with it. Removed, and
nothing replaced it — "which record" is answered by the entity type on the row
and by the diff itself.

### 2. `--c-info` was a raw tenant accent used as TYPE

The ledger's debit amounts measured **4.38:1** in light mode on tenant B.
`brandingCssVars` assigned `'--c-info': accentColor` unchanged, and every
`--c-info` usage in `app.css` is a `color:` — the tinted grounds all read
`--c-info-soft`. So a school's accent, chosen as a fill, was being used as text
with no readability derivation.

This is the same bug P4 fixed for `--c-primary-text` and did not generalise.
Tenant B's accent is `#a76a47` — the exact colour the avatar palette had to
darken in P4 for the same reason, arriving by a second route. It now goes
through `readableBrandText` against both grounds it lands on, in both themes,
with a test over eight brands.

### 3. Branding offered a class teacher twelve live fields and a dead save

`readOnly` was set only when `GET /ops/branding` returned 403 — and that GET is
**public**: branding is what the login screen draws before anybody signs in. So
a teacher got 200, twelve editable inputs, no explanation, and a save that
could only ever fail. The exact "invitation to a 403" this codebase avoids
everywhere else.

Now derived from the role, mirroring `BRANDING_WRITERS` in the endpoint.
Proven both ways in a browser: a class teacher gets **0 of 12** fields editable
and the sentence "আপনি শুধু দেখতে পারবেন — পরিবর্তনের অনুমতি প্রধান শিক্ষক বা
আইটি প্রশাসকের।"; an IT admin gets **12 of 12**.

## One more permission wording folded in

`audit-view` had a bespoke refusal predating B-30, plus
`this.error.includes('কেবল')` deciding whether to draw a retry — control flow
reading a substring of a sentence, which breaks the day somebody rewords it.
Now a `denied` flag and `permissionState`, with the roles that CAN read the log
kept in the detail line: a generic sentence would have lost information the
bespoke one carried, and "these three can see it" is more useful to a refused
coordinator than "ask the head teacher".

## A measurement artifact, recorded as a non-defect

The sweep reported `INPUT:13` — a 13px-tall checkbox — as a tap-target failure
across several screens. Measured directly: the enclosing `<label>` is
**48 × 1077** and clicking it toggles the box, so the target is compliant and
the probe was measuring the wrong element. The probe now measures the enclosing
label when there is one. Same class as P4's transition artifacts: worth writing
down so the next sweep does not rediscover it.

## Browser acceptance

Transitions frozen. `d-rail-toggle` at 32×32 is a desktop-only `pointer: fine`
control, above WCAG 2.2 AA's 24px and below the probe's 44px, and is left as it
is — the mobile surfaces have no sub-44px target.

| Persona | Widths | Routes | Checks | Failures |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| IT Admin, tenant A | 375 · 1024 · 1440 | 10 | 1,223 | **0** |
| Principal, tenant B | 360 · 768 · 1440 · 1600 | 17 / 7 | 2,738 | **0** |

Both themes at every width. **0 contrast failures, 0 horizontal overflow,
0 unnamed controls, 0 `undefined`, 0 uuids on screen** — the last one being the
audit fix, verified as an absence across every route rather than on the one
screen that had it.

## Security, proven as a pair

Driving the demo as a **class teacher** and typing management URLs:

| Route | Result |
|---|---|
| `users` | refused, canonical sentence |
| `institution` | refused |
| `rollover` | refused |
| `audit` | refused, and names the three roles that may read it |
| `branding` | renders **read-only**, 0/12 fields editable, and says why |
| `settings`, `imports` | not registered for this role — the teacher home renders |
| `system` | renders: it probes public endpoints and holds no tenant data |

And the legitimate half: an IT admin gets 12/12 branding fields and the full
user table with both actions.

**Not evidence, and not claimed as such:** `/api/v1/platform/tenants` answers
503 from the static preview because the preview mounts no API. The platform
boundary is proven by `services/platform-svc`'s own suite (26 tests) and by
R-7's three-credential design, not by that 503.

## B-7 regression, after the surrounding UI moved

Re-run twice with the rest of the DB suites: 16/16 both times. The guardian
unlink still ends future visibility, still leaves the row and its history, and
still stops the absence SMS — asserted by running the dispatcher's own query
under the dispatcher's own role.

## Gate

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Full suite | **1,476 passing**, 12 workspaces |
| Key DB suites ×2 | 57/57, 57/57 (b6 · b7 · p4-privacy · b15) |
| TypeScript — all three CI configs | 0 errors |
| Build | app.js + sw.js + 11 API bundles |
| Migrations | 50/50, fully migrated |
| `index.html` | SHA `496199bd` — unchanged |

## What B-34 still does NOT cover

P5 stays **PARTIAL**. Named precisely, because the completion gate is a list
and this is the part of it that is not ticked:

- **Academic structure** keeps its own markup. The hierarchy renders and works
  — year → class → group → section → teacher → students, with the P5 rename
  drawer on it — but it was not rebuilt on `dataTable`/P2 primitives, and the
  brief asks for that explicitly.
- **Imports** were not touched: no dry-run/validation/retry states reviewed,
  and "do not lose user input on a recoverable error" is unverified.
- **Settings** hierarchy was not restructured.
- **Guardians, teachers** have no dedicated list screens; they are reached
  through the student drawer and the user list.
- **Publish/results, calendar, documents, fees, invoices, ledger, compose,
  inbox** render and sweep clean, but were not migrated to P2 primitives.
- **System health** keeps its own four-state vocabulary (`on` · `dark` ·
  `invisible` · `unknown`) rather than the brief's healthy/warning/blocked/
  unavailable. It probes real endpoints and fakes nothing; the mapping is
  recorded rather than churned, because "invisible by design" is a state the
  brief's four words cannot express and an operator needs.

**Commit:** `5800906`.

# P5 — the remaining IT Admin and Principal screens   (2026-09-01) · **COMPLETE**

Closes P5. Fourteen screens migrated, **eleven defects found and fixed** — five
of them security or privacy, one of them a screen that fabricated a school's
accounts under a refusal.

---

## What the measurement said before any code

Rendered at 1440 as each persona, and counted:

| Screen | What was actually there |
|---|---|
| `academic` | 2 `.system-row` across a 1110px column, counts pushed to the far edge |
| `documents` | 6 `.system-row` @1120 |
| `fees` | 3 `.fees-row` @1120 |
| `invoices` | 3 `.system-row` @1120 |
| `ledger` | 5 `.ledger-row` @1110 |
| `system` | 12 `.card.system-row` @1110 |
| all of them | **0 `.ui-card`, 0 `.ui-btn`, 0 `.ui-field`** |

So the finding was the same one B-34 made and the diagnosis was the same: the
MOBILE shape was already right and the DESKTOP shape was a phone layout
stretched, which is what §4 forbids outright.

## Migrated

| Screen | Shape now |
|---|---|
| **academic** | four depths, four tables — classes · sections · subjects · roster · history — plus real crumbs and both forms on `field()` |
| **import** | rebuilt: role-chosen kind, resolved year, `fileUpload`, error table, confirmation |
| **settings** | two groups — what this endpoint owns, and what lives on its own screen |
| **system** | table + a legend defining all four states |
| **fees** | table, with the invoice's lines and receipts in a drawer |
| **invoices** | form on `field()` + a table of recent runs |
| **ledger** | stat cards for reconciliation, a table for accounts, one DR/CR table per batch |
| **documents** | choice-cards in a grid; the type as a crumb |
| **publish** | `card()` per exam, a table for per-subject completeness |
| **calendar** | every control on P2; the form's errors per-field |
| **compose** | the two text fields on `field()`; the header on `pageHeader` |
| **inbox** | `pageHeader`, `countBadge`, canonical states, `au-rows` desktop rhythm |
| **results** | chrome only — see the exceptions below |

### Two deliberate exceptions, each with a reason

- **`results` keeps its own `<table>`.** It already builds correct markup with
  `th scope=row`, a conditional practical/CA column set, a superscript tied to
  a footnote, and — the part `dataTable` cannot express — a `colSpan` cell
  reading **অনুপস্থিত** across the marks of a child who did not sit the exam.
  Migrating it would have DELETED that.
- **`inbox` stays a disclosure list**, like `audit`. A notice is a title that
  opens into a paragraph, and a table cell cannot hold a paragraph.

## Eleven defects

### Security and privacy — found by driving the matrix, not by reading code

**1. `ledger-view` answered a 403 by fabricating a ledger.** The worst of the
eleven, and it is in the PRODUCT rather than the demo:

```ts
} else if (res.status === 401 || res.status === 403) {
  this.notice = 'শুধু হিসাবরক্ষক পর্যায়ের জন্য — নমুনা ডেটা দেখানো হচ্ছে।';
  this.data = DEMO;
```

A refused coordinator was shown a complete chart of accounts, MFS
reconciliation totals and three double-entry batches in taka, under one quiet
line calling them samples. B-30's "a refusal is not a data state" and the
standing rule against faking production state, at once. The fallback is gone;
the fixture moved into `demo.ts` where it is gated by role.

**2. Three finance endpoints were ungated in the demo.** `/finance/ledger`,
`/finance/invoices`, `/finance/receipts` — so the PUBLIC preview showed a class
teacher the school's books and three invoices, which `LEDGER_ROLES` and
`invoice_scope` both refuse. Same class as P4's role-switch cache leak, on the
same public surface. `/ops/settings` was ungated too: a student read the
school's SMS cost policy.

**3. `users-view` offered a live search bar under its own refusal.** The
refusal rendered correctly, and then a name box, a role filter and a
"খুঁজুন" button — three controls whose only outcome is a second 403.

**4. The notice composer gave a student the whole form**, audience chips and
all: "শিক্ষকদের জন্য · অভিভাবকদের জন্য". `AUTHOR_ROLES` would have refused
the send. A screen that offers a child a broadcast to nine hundred families
and then fails is worse than one that says no.

**5. "একসাথে সবার" was offered to a student.** `DOCS_FOR` rightly lets a
family print its own mark sheet; the BULK badge came off the document spec, so
it was shown to everyone. The endpoint is safe — `app.can_see_student` narrows
a student's section request to their own row — but the badge promised a
capability the reader does not have.

### Correctness

**6. Student import could not work at all.** `academicYearId` was an optional
option nobody passed — `app.ts` mounts `new ImportView({ root, doc, auth })` —
so every request went out without a year and came back 400. The screen now
asks `/hierarchy` itself.

**7. The teacher importer had no UI.** R-7 shipped `runTeacherImport` and the
endpoint gates it to principal · owner · **IT admin** — and this screen sent
`kind: 'student'` unconditionally, which those same IT admins may not do. So
the one import an IT admin may run was unreachable and the one they could
reach refused them. The nav said "শিক্ষার্থী আমদানি" to them, naming the one
thing they cannot do; a **principal had no import nav entry at all**, though
784 rows on day one is their job.

**8. `requireRole` printed English role codes into a Bangla UI.**

```
this endpoint requires one of: principal, school_owner, it_admin
```

Fifteen views rendered `body.message ?? 'কিছু হয়নি'`, which is right when the
endpoint wrote a sentence for a person and wrong when it did not. Fixed at the
seam — `serverMessage()` uses a server's words only when they are written in
the language the reader is reading, and never for a 401/403.

**9. `isDenied(res)` silently returned `false` everywhere.** Mine: I wrote it
against `Response` at four new call sites, and it only understood a thrown
`HttpStatus`. A refusal check that never fires is worse than none, because the
screen looks like it has one. `statusOf` now reads the property, not the class.

### UI truth

**10. `2026-08` and `2026-08-10` on screen.** A billing period as a database
key and an ISO date, both in front of a parent. `bnMonth` is new because
`Date.parse('2026-08')` succeeds — `bnDate` would have printed "১ আগস্ট ২০২৬",
a day the invoice has nothing to do with.

**11. `fileUpload`'s hidden input scrolled the page sideways.** A dead rule,
`.import-card input[type='file'] { width: 100% }`, outranked `.ui-sr-only` on
specificity: a 1270px invisible input inside a 1280px viewport. Found only
because **1280 was driven this time** — B-34 never measured it. The dead rule
is gone AND `.ui-sr-only` is now unarguable for controls, because any legacy
descendant selector with a width could do this again.

## System health: the vocabulary, derived rather than invented

The brief proposed healthy / warning / blocked / unavailable. Four words
cannot express the state most of that list is in, so the MODEL is unchanged
and only the naming moved:

| was | is | means |
|---|---|---|
| `on` | **চালু আছে** | the endpoint answered |
| `invisible` | **সবসময় চালু** | a database- or server-level guarantee. No page, no switch, nothing to check |
| `dark` | **ইচ্ছাকৃতভাবে বন্ধ** | a kill switch is on. **Not a fault** — a school reading "সমস্যা" against AI files a ticket about a decision |
| `unknown` | **যাচাই করা যায়নি** | the probe got no answer |

Every state is now defined on the screen itself. Nothing reports a health it
did not measure: `সবসময় চালু` says so out loud by never being probed.

## Primitives that grew

- `Crumb.onClick` — the academic screen is four levels deep behind one hash,
  and a crumb that can only carry a `path` is decoration on a screen like that
- `FieldKind: 'month'` — a billing period is a month, not a day
- `serverMessage()` — see defect 8
- `.ui-facts`, `.ui-card-lead/-note`, `.ui-card-grid`, `.ui-check`,
  `.ui-fieldset` — five shapes that five screens were each inventing

## Browser acceptance

Both personas, both themes, **seven widths including 1280**, transitions frozen.

| Persona | Widths | Routes | Element checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| IT Admin, tenant A | 360 · 375 · 390 · 1024 · 1280 · 1440 · 1600 | 10 | 6,226 |
| Principal, tenant B | same seven | 17 | 13,586 |
| | | | **19,812** |

**0 contrast failures · 0 horizontal overflow · 0 unnamed controls ·
0 `undefined` · 0 uuids on screen · 0 ISO dates presented as values.**

Two accepted exceptions, both desktop-only `pointer: fine` and both above
WCAG 2.2 AA's 24×24: `d-rail-toggle` at 32×32, and a collapsed-rail `dnav` at
41×44 (the sidebar auto-collapses at 1024). No mobile surface has a sub-44px
target — the calendar's day cells were 40px at 360 and were fixed by giving
the grid its gutters back below 400px.

Branding, measured: tenant A `--c-primary: #156a3f`, tenant B `#1b3e7a`, with
`--c-info` derived per tenant AND per theme (B-34's fix) to four different
values across the four combinations.

## Security matrix, as pairs

**Refused, canonical sentence, 0 rows, 0 live controls:**

| Role | Routes refused |
|---|---|
| class teacher | users · audit · rollover · publish · invoices · ledger · fees · import · adminsettings |
| student | + academic · compose |
| guardian | same as student |

Read-only where read-only is right: `branding` for a class teacher (0 of 12
fields, and says why), `academic` for a class teacher (2 class rows, no create
or rename controls), `documents` for a family (own receipt, own mark sheet,
own admit card — **and no bulk badge**).

**Legitimate half:** a principal meets no refusal on any of 17 routes. An IT
admin gets 26 live controls on `users`, 12 branding fields, academic, settings,
audit, rollover, staff import and system health — **and is refused from
`ledger` and `invoices`**, because the school's money is not their job.

Platform console: no route, no nav entry, and `#/platform` falls through to
home. **Not claimed as evidence:** `/api/v1/platform/tenants` answers 503 from
the static preview because the preview mounts no API; the boundary rests on
platform-svc's 26 tests and R-7's three-credential design.

D16: no subscription, plan, package or billing-of-shikhonBD wording on any of
the 27 routes swept.

## Tests

`apps/pwa/test/p5-screens.test.ts` — 30 tests. The one that matters is named
as such: **a 403 shows the refusal and NO numbers**, asserting the absence of
`MFS-BKASH`, of `18450`, and of the word নমুনা.

**Five existing suites were re-pointed, none weakened.** Every assertion keeps
its meaning; what changed is how the control is addressed:

- `notices-ui`, `notice-safety` — `.login-input` → `[name="title"]` /
  `[name="body"]`. `notice-safety`'s stub also had to say who it was, because
  the composer now refuses a role outside `AUTHOR_ROLES` and the stub had
  never set one while claiming `canPublishAll: true`.
- `import-view` — the totals are stat cards, the errors are a table, and the
  commit passes through a confirmation. One assertion got STRONGER: with no
  importable rows the button is not rendered at all, where it used to be
  rendered and disabled.
- `calendar-ui` — `.card-form` → `.ui-card-form`, and the shared `[role=alert]`
  became the title field's own error slot, which is the improvement: the old
  form said "শিরোনাম লিখুন" above the date input.
- `admin-ui` — the drill-down is a table, the number field is `type=text` with
  `inputmode=numeric` by P2's own decision, and three bespoke refusal
  sentences became the canonical one asserted through `permissionMessage()` so
  it cannot drift again.

## Gate

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Full suite | **1,506 passing**, 0 failing, 12 workspaces |
| TypeScript — all three CI configs | 0 errors |
| Typecheck drift guard | passed; baseline 63 → **64** (the new test file, which joins the 49 test files already outside every tsconfig — no exclusion was changed) |
| Build | app.js + sw.js + 11 API bundles |
| Migrations | **50/50**, fully migrated |
| `index.html` | git hash `496199bd` — unchanged |
| Browser | 19,812 element checks, 0 failures |

**One disclosed anomaly.** The first of ten runs of `b6-structure-edit` +
`b7-guardian-revoke` reported `pass 12, fail 1`; the failing test was not
captured. It did not reproduce in **nine** subsequent runs — three sequential,
three in the same shape as the original, three in parallel with academics-svc —
all `28/28`. The most likely cause is contention with the full `npm test` run
that had just finished against the same database, but that is **INFERRED, not
established**. Recorded rather than smoothed over.

## Backlog

**B-34 → RESOLVED.** Every screen the completion gate names is on the design
system, or is a recorded exception with a reason.

**Commit:** `fabf4f1`.

# P6 — the functional screens with no design reference   (2026-09-01) · **COMPLETE**

Nineteen screens across four families, **fourteen defects**, and the P5 flake
found, reproduced on demand and fenced.

---

## P6-0 — the inventory, before any code

All 41 routes rendered as five roles at 1440 and measured, rather than read off
the old P6 list. The classification that came back:

| Class | Count | Which |
|---|---|---|
| already final | 20 | everything P3/P4/P5 owned |
| partially migrated | 5 | `marks` · `routine` · `my-attendance` · `scripts` · `results` |
| **missing design** | 14 | the rest of the More-menu satellites, the coordinator's planning tools, the student's learning surfaces, `institution` |
| legacy but acceptable | 1 | `login-view` — outside the shell, its own visual contract |
| not a route | 2 | `attendance-view` · `practice-view` are child components |
| out of scope | 1 | the platform console is not a tenant screen |

Two classification calls worth naming:

- **`institution` is a near-DUPLICATE, not a missing design.** It reads the
  same endpoint as the Principal dashboard P5 rebuilt and shows substantially
  the same figures, in R-3 markup. Whether a school wants two dashboards is an
  **owner decision and is not taken here**. What P6 did is stop them competing:
  `home` answers *what needs me now*, `institution` answers *what this school
  is* — the standing shape first, then today measured against it. Same data,
  opposite order, and every heading names its question.
- **`roles` is an explainer**, not an operational screen, and is classified as
  such. It got the canonical shell and a table; nothing more.

## Fourteen defects

### Security — found by driving the matrix as a student, not by reading code

**1. The teacher's AI generator was offered to a student.** `#/sikhok` handed a
child the complete form — task type, class, subject, chapter, instructions and
a live "তৈরি করুন". `requireStaff` refuses the endpoint, so nothing could have
been generated; offering it anyway implies a student may write their own exam
questions.

**2. Answer-script upload was offered to a student.** Three pickers and a
camera trigger for uploading another child's script.

Both now mirror `requireStaff`'s blocklist exactly. Re-driven as student AND
guardian: refused, 0 rows, 0 live controls, canonical sentence.

### Contradictory states — two screens claiming two things at once

**3. `examroutine`** rendered *"পরীক্ষার তালিকা লোড হয়নি।"* **and**
*"এই শিক্ষাবর্ষে কোনো পরীক্ষার সময়সূচি তৈরি হয়নি।"*
**4. `routineeditor`** rendered *"রুটিন লোড হয়নি"* **and**
*"এই শাখার জন্য কোনো রুটিন তৈরি হয়নি।"*

The second claim is not knowable when the first is true: a failed load does not
know whether the school has exams, only that it could not find out. "There is
nothing here" is a fact about the SCHOOL; "it did not load" is a fact about the
connection. An error is now the whole answer, with a retry.

### A primitive that never did what it said

**5. `emptyState`'s `glyph` was ignored.** It took an icon name and rendered a
literal `·`, with a comment blaming an import cycle with `icon.ts` — which
imports nothing, from a module that imports nothing. **Five screens** worked
around it by hand-rolling `.empty-glyph` with a literal `⃝` (U+20DD COMBINING
ENCLOSING CIRCLE), a combining mark with nothing to combine with, which renders
as a stray ring on most Android fonts. Five copies of one workaround is how a
workaround becomes the house style. The primitive draws the icon now; all five
rings are gone.

**6. `.ui-card` used `width: 100%`.** A block element with `width: 100%` and any
horizontal margin is wider than its container by exactly those margins, and
`box-sizing` cannot help — margins are outside the box either way.
`my-attendance` inherited `.att-summary { margin: 0 var(--s-4) }` from before it
was a card and scrolled a 1024px page sideways. Found by my OWN sweep after my
OWN change. `width: auto` fills the container minus margins, which is what a
card wants and what any legacy class handed to `card({ className })` needs.

### Language and content

**7. "শ্রেণি 6 … শ্রেণি 12"** — Latin digits on the one control that names a
class. My first fix was also wrong: `${bn(c)}ম শ্রেণি` gives "১১ম" where a
Bangladeshi school says **একাদশ**. That is P4's "২ম পিরিয়ড" bug for the second
time. The correct table has been in `structure-forms.ts` since R-3; it moved to
`ui-core` as `levelNameBn` so there is one.

**8. An English `aria-label` on every chapter card.** `learn-view` announced
`"…, 2 of 4 topics done"` in the middle of a Bangla page, to the one reader who
has nothing but the announcement.

**9. Page sizes in Latin digits** on the script uploader, where every other
count in the product is Bangla.

**10. A raw ISO date** printed on `substitute`'s candidate stage.

### Controls with no name

**11–13.** `substitute`'s date input had **no label of any kind** — not even an
`aria-label` — on the screen whose entire question is which day. `marks`,
`classperf`, `routineeditor` and `subjectchoice` each had a bare `<select>` with
an `aria-label` only: announced to a screen reader, invisible to everyone else
until they opened it.

**14. Three screens had no page header at all**: `more`, `sikhok`, `shikho`. On
`more` that is the one screen every role reaches.

---

## The P5 flake: reproduced, diagnosed, fenced

P5 recorded one non-reproducible `pass 12, fail 1` on `b6`+`b7` and said the
cause was **INFERRED, not established**. P6 established it.

Every DB suite here builds fixtures at FIXED uuids and drops them in `after`.
That is deliberate and readable — `SEC_A = '7b06d000-…-e1'` can be reasoned
about — and safe while one process owns those rows. Two runs of the SAME suite
overlapping do not fail loudly: they delete each other's fixtures halfway
through and report a scatter of assertions with no common cause.

Running `b6`+`b7` **three times concurrently reproduced it on demand**, with
P5's exact `pass 12` signature.

Different suites are safe from each other — disjoint id prefixes — which is why
`npm test` has never shown it: `test-all.mjs` runs workspaces sequentially.
What is not safe is a suite overlapping itself, which is easy to do by hand and
invisible when it happens.

**The fix, in one place:** a session-scoped `pg_advisory_lock` taken for the
life of a test process, wired into all **26** DB-backed suites. Two overlapping
runs queue instead of corrupting each other — a race becomes a wait. Session
scope beats a lock table because a killed test process cannot leave the next
one waiting forever.

**Proof:** the reproduction that failed 16 tests now returns 28/28 from all
three concurrent workers.

Rewriting 26 suites onto per-run fixture ids would be the deeper fix and was
not attempted — it is a large change across a dozen files late in a phase, and
the lock removes the failure mode entirely.

## Migrated

| Family | Screens |
|---|---|
| **A — teacher satellites** | `assignments` (dataTable, two audiences from one column definition) · `marks` · `scripts` · `classperf` · `routine` · `sikhok` |
| **B — coordinator planning** | `substitute` (table + candidate drawer) · `examroutine` · `routineeditor` · `generation` · `subjectchoice` |
| **C — student learning** | `subjects` · `learn` · `shikho` · `my-attendance` |
| **D — cross-role shell** | `more` · `notifications` · `roles` · `institution` |

### The one screen that earned a different desktop shape

**`routine`'s week view is now a real grid** — periods down, days across, a
`<table>` with `<th scope>` on both axes. It was the day list seven times over,
stacked, each row 1120px wide, so "what do I teach Wednesday period 3" meant
scrolling past two days and counting. Mobile keeps the stacked list: a 7×8 grid
at 360px is unusable. Both are in the DOM and CSS picks one, the same decision
`dataTable` makes and for the same reason.

### Deliberate exceptions, each with a reason

- **`marks`' entry grid stays.** A spreadsheet with per-cell dirty state and
  per-cell offline queueing; `dataTable` has neither. Replacing it would trade
  a working offline mark sheet for a consistent-looking one.
- **`exam-routine`'s table stays.** It inserts an inline reschedule row with a
  `colSpan` under a clashing paper.
- **`routineeditor`'s period×day grid stays** — already a correct table.
- **`class-perf`'s component bars stay.** ~20 lines of CSS width on a token,
  not a charting library; 04-UIUX §6 forbids the library, not the bar.
- **`my-attendance`'s month bars stay**, same reasoning. Its REGISTER became a
  table, because "which days, and was it late or excused" is four facts a row.

## Browser acceptance

Both themes, seven widths, tenant A and B, transitions frozen.

| Persona | Widths | Routes | Element checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Teacher, tenant A | 360 · 375 · 390 · 1024 · 1280 · 1440 · 1600 | 14 | 9,340 |
| Student, tenant B | same seven | 12 | 8,196 |
| Coordinator, tenant A | 360 · 1024 · 1440 · 1600 | 17 | 6,618 |
| **P5 regression** — Principal, tenant B | 360 · 1024 · 1440 | 17 | 5,788 |

**0 contrast failures · 0 horizontal overflow · 0 unnamed controls ·
0 `undefined` · 0 uuids · 0 ISO dates as values.**

The P5 sweep was re-run in full because `.ui-card`'s width change touches every
card in the product. Unregressed.

Two accepted exceptions, unchanged from P5 and both desktop-only `pointer:
fine`, above WCAG 2.2 AA's 24×24: `d-rail-toggle` at 32×32, and a
collapsed-rail `dnav` at 41×44 at 1024.

## Gate

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Full suite | **1,521 passing**, 0 failing, 12 workspaces — run **twice** |
| Key DB suites | **b6+b7 ×11**, academics ×8, all clean · **the concurrency reproduction now passes 3/3** |
| TypeScript — all three CI configs | 0 errors |
| Typecheck drift guard | passed; baseline 64 → **65** (the new test file) |
| Build | app.js + sw.js + 11 API bundles |
| Migrations | **50/50**, fully migrated |
| `index.html` | git hash `496199bd` — unchanged |

## Open, and recorded rather than decided

**`home` and `institution` overlap.** P6 gave them different questions and
orders so they no longer read as two versions of one screen, but a school may
still not want two. That is a product decision for the owner, not a design one,
and it is written here rather than taken.

**Commit:** `5b8540d`.

# P7 — the Platform Operations Center   (2026-09-02) · **COMPLETE**

The phase brief asked for a console "from which our team can safely operate
many schools without losing control". The inventory found the opposite of a
control problem: a console full of controls, **three of which did nothing at
all**. Everything else in P7 follows from fixing that.

---

## P7-0 — the owner decision, taken

P6 left `home` and `institution` as two dashboards over one endpoint and
recorded, correctly, that choosing between them was the owner's call. P7 was
told to resolve it and to recommend rather than pick silently.

**Recommendation, and what was done: `home` is the Principal's one daily
surface.** `institution` is now a redirect to it, its sidebar entry is gone,
and the bottom tab it occupied went to `attendance` — after the day's
dashboard, the roll is what a principal opens every morning. `principal-view.ts`
was deleted rather than left unreachable.

The reasoning is not aesthetic. Two screens over one endpoint means two places
to change when the endpoint changes, and P5 had already rebuilt `home` on the
design system while `institution` stayed in R-3 markup. Keeping both meant
carrying a second, older answer to the same question.

The deletion was caught by `nav.test.ts` a day later: the tab bar still listed
`institution` after the sidebar stopped doing so. That test exists precisely to
catch a half-done removal, and it did.

---

## P7-1 — the inventory, and the finding the phase turned on

The brief said to build a capability matrix before adding anything. The matrix
is what found this:

> **`app.set_tenant_status` wrote `tenants.status`. The console had a button
> for it. The audit log recorded it. And not one line of application code read
> that column.**

An operator could suspend a school, be told it worked, and the school kept
working. Every screen, every login, every write.

The same shape then turned up twice more in the machinery built to replace it:

| Control | Built in | Read by | Effect on the product |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tenants.status` suspension | R-7 | nothing | **none** |
| `tenant_operations.portals` | 052 | nothing | **none** |
| `tenant_operations.services` | 052 | the console itself, twice | **none** |

Three controls, three audit trails, three success messages, zero enforcement.
A control whose only effect is on the screen that operates it is worse than no
control: it is a sentence an operator repeats to a headmaster.

---

## Where the gate went, and why there

`withTenant` is the one function every tenant request already passes through,
and it already spends a round trip setting three GUCs. The gate rides on that
round trip.

Not `authenticate`: it verifies a JWT and touches no database, which is why it
is fast and why the platform service can share it. A tenant lookup there would
give every request — including the ones that fail auth — a round trip it does
not need.

Not the 109 endpoint call sites: an enforcement anybody can forget is an
enforcement that will be forgotten, and the endpoint written six months from
now is the one that forgets.

**Zero of 109 call sites were edited to make reads and writes obey.**

Three properties fell out of that placement:

- **Read-only is enforced by the database, not by discipline.** A limited or
  in-maintenance school gets `SET LOCAL transaction_read_only = on`, so an
  endpoint cannot write by forgetting to check. SQLSTATE 25006 is translated
  back into a sentence about the school's account.
- **`TenantBlocked extends HttpError`**, so all 54 existing `instanceof
  HttpError` catch sites already refuse it correctly, with a Bangla message.
- **It fails closed.** No row, a missing function, a dead connection: the
  answer is `none`. A gate that opens when it is confused is not a gate, and
  the failure it would create is exactly the one this phase exists to fix.

---

## Migrations

| # | What |
|---|---|
| **051** | The commercial model: `plans`, `tenant_operations`, `tenant_payments`, `service_catalogue` (13 services with their Bangla consequences and dependencies), 4 seed plans |
| **052** | The gate: `tenant_billing_state`, `tenant_access`, `tenant_service_state`, `portal_of`, `tenant_portal_open`, `ensure_tenant_operations` |
| **053** | The console's own read path — and the write to `tenants` it could not make |
| **054** | The portal switch, made real |
| **055** | The service switches, made real |
| **056** | `portal_of` must not sweep the machinery in with the teachers |
| **057** | When did anybody last actually USE this school |
| **058** | A catalogue cannot name a service that does not exist |

### The billing lifecycle is derived, never stored

`ACTIVE → PAYMENT_DUE → GRACE_PERIOD → LIMITED → SUSPENDED` is computed by
`app.tenant_billing_state` from the due date, the plan's grace days, any
explicit grace, and the trial. There is no status field for an operator to set
and therefore no status field to drift. The console says so on the screen, so
nobody hunts for the field.

---

## Nine defects, and what each one was

**1. A GRANT is not a POLICY.** `shikhon_platform` had `GRANT ALL` on
`tenant_operations` and no RLS policy. With RLS on, that is zero rows and
`UPDATE … rowCount: 0` — no error. Every toggle in the console would have
reported success and changed nothing. *This is the third time in one phase that
a silent zero-row result impersonated success.*

**2. A POLICY is not a BYPASS.** `/overview` selected `FROM tenants` as the
platform role and returned **0 of 37 schools with a 200**. `tenant_self` was
doing its job; the console needed a SECURITY DEFINER door, which is exactly why
R-7 built `app.platform_tenants()`. Migration 053.

**3. Every school created after 051 would have been born suspended.**
`app.create_tenant` did not write `tenant_operations` and `tenant_access`
INNER JOINed it. Fixed twice over: an AFTER INSERT trigger, and a LEFT JOIN
with `COALESCE(o.ops_state, 'active')`.

**4. `UPDATE tenants SET student_cap` was another silent no-op** for the same
reason as (2). Now `app.set_student_cap`, which also refuses a cap below the
roll — a cap under the enrolment makes `enforce_student_cap` reject every
future admission with nothing on screen to explain why.

**5. Closing the teacher portal would have stopped every login in the
school.** `portal_of` named five roles and folded everything else into
`teacher`. `system_ingest` is not a teacher: it is what `otp-request`,
`otp-verify`, `refresh`, `activate`, `logout` and the SMS run execute as. The
moment 054 made portals real, the teacher switch would have locked out
students, guardians and the principal who had to undo it, and killed the SMS
pipeline on the way past — and the console would have called it "teachers
cannot sign in". Migration 056.

**6. `sync-svc` kept its own copy of `db.ts` and enforced none of the gate.**
Its header claimed an "identical contract" to server-core's, and it was
identical right up until it wasn't. This was the widest hole in the scheme:
sync is how attendance, exam marks, submissions and lesson progress are
actually written — from phones, in bulk, hours late. A suspended school would
have gone on filing a week of rolls through it. The file is now a re-export;
there is one implementation.

**7. A calendar date is not an instant.** `pg` parses DATE into a `Date` at the
host's local midnight, so `2025-07-28` became `2025-07-27T18:00Z` and the
console showed a billing due date **one day early**. `TenantBlocked.until` was
worse: `String(Date).slice(0, 10)` yields `"Mon Jul 28"`. Fixed at the source —
OID 1082 hands back the string the wire already carries. Timestamps are
untouched; those really are instants.

**8. Every dangerous action showed a confirmation nobody could answer.** The
confirm dialogue was appended to the page; every one of them is raised from
inside the command-centre drawer, which is a real modal — scrim at z-index 50,
everything outside marked `aria-hidden`. `elementFromPoint` over the confirm
button returned drawer content. Suspend, limit, maintenance, close a portal,
disable a service, change a plan: **all six unanswerable**, and invisible to a
screen reader. A confirmation now belongs to the thing that raised it.

**9. Twenty row buttons, one name.** The desktop table labelled its open button
from the COLUMN HEADER, so a reader tabbing a class list heard "নাম: খুলুন"
forty times with nothing to tell the children apart. Fixed in the P2 primitive,
so every table in the product gained it at once.

---

## Two defects the new tests found on their own

**`user-x` and `grid` never existed.** The Principal's absentee card and
section count have been drawing a fallback dot since P5. `ui/dom.ts` already
carried a comment recording that this exact class of bug shipped once before —
a `search` glyph missing from R-6 until P1 — and there was still nothing
stopping it. P7 reproduced it immediately with `plus-circle` and
`alert-circle`, which is enough evidence that "remember to check the list" is
not a working control. `icon-names.test.ts` reads the names out of the source
and found both P5 survivors on its first run.

**A count in Latin digits inside a Bangla sentence.** "এই প্রতিষ্ঠানে এখন 10
জন" — two of them, in the cap refusals. `capMessageBn` directly above them had
been doing it correctly all along.

---

## The test hang that was not a flaky test

Two DB runs in this phase stalled for about forty minutes each, reporting
nothing: no failing test, no output, just suites that never finished. B-35's
advisory lock was blamed. B-35 was not the problem.

The mechanism, once run one workspace at a time:

1. A suite's `before` hook creates its tenant **inside `withTenant`** — and
   the gate refuses a school that does not exist yet. That refusal is correct;
   `tenant-gate.test.ts` asserts it as a security property, and production does
   the same thing through `app.create_tenant` with `skipGate`.
2. `before` throws, so `after` runs — and throws on the same broken state,
   before reaching `unlockFixtures`.
3. The lock is session-scoped, so it *would* be released when the process
   exited. But the pg Client's socket keeps the event loop alive, so the
   process never exits. It sits there holding the lock while every other DB
   suite in the repository waits on it.

Three fixes, in order of how much they buy:

- **`unref()` on the lock connection.** A suite that dies badly now lets go.
  This turns "the tests hang" into a named failure in 200 ms. The one change
  that matters.
- **`asBootstrap`** in the harness, and 67 fixture call sites moved onto it.
  Creating the school a suite is made of is the one act that cannot pass a
  check on the school. Tests still go through the gate, because a test that
  skips it is testing something the product does not do.
- **Two suites had the bug in a subtler form** — `allowlist` and `push-send`
  cleaned child tables for a tenant they had not created yet.

`sms-svc` went from a forty-minute hang to **67 passing in 0.8 seconds**.

B-36 records the remaining harness weakness: the lock still has no timeout, so
a *live* wedge would still queue behind it silently.

---

## What the console can now do that only SQL could before

Every one of these has a screen, a stated consequence, a confirmation and an
audit row carrying the operator's own sentence:

institution state (active · maintenance · limited · suspended) · per-service
enable/disable/maintenance with dependency refusal · portal open/close per role
with lock-out refusal · plan change · student cap · manual payment with
duplicate refusal · grace period.

**Nothing in the commercial or service model is SQL-only.**

The plan change was the last hold-out: it existed only on R-7's provisioning
screen, and recorded *what* changed with no *why*. It is now in the billing tab
where an operator looks at money, it states all four consequences (price, cap,
services, grace) before it happens, and `/plan` demands a reason like every
other mutation.

---

## Proven end to end, not asserted

Driven through the real API against a real database, on a real school:

| Act | Result |
|---|---|
| operator disables `notices` | `ops/notices` and `ops/inbox` → 403 with "নোটিশ এই প্রতিষ্ঠানের জন্য আপাতত বন্ধ রাখা হয়েছে।" |
| …and `ops/calendar`, `ops/settings` | still 200 — no collateral damage, and no school locked out of itself |
| school in maintenance | GET 200, POST 403 saying **"ডাটাবেস আপগ্রেড চলছে"** — the operator's own words, not a service-shaped guess |
| school suspended | every endpoint 403 |
| teacher portal closed | teachers `none`, principal `full`, **login unaffected** |
| five changes on A | B byte-identical before and after |
| cap below the roll | refused, naming both numbers in Bangla digits |
| cap on a *suspended* school | allowed — otherwise a suspended school could never be fixed |

### The security matrix

| Credential | `/platform/overview` | `/platform/opsstate` |
|---|---|---|
| principal · it_admin · class_teacher · accountant · student · guardian | **403** | **403** |
| super_admin, no platform key | **403** | — |
| super_admin, wrong platform key | **403** | — |
| platform key, no token | **401** | — |

Both credentials are required, independently.

---

## §32 support mode — deferred, with the blocker named

The brief permitted deferral if the auth architecture could not carry it
safely. It cannot, and the reason is specific: **14 RLS policies key off
`app.current_user_id()` and 4 more off `app.my_section_ids()`**. A platform
admin has no `users` row inside the school, so those 18 policies evaluate
against an id that does not exist and return nothing — a support session would
show a *different screen* from the one the person is calling about. That is
worse than no support mode, because support would then debug a screen nobody is
looking at. Making it show the same screen means adopting a real user's
identity, which is the silent impersonation the brief forbids.

Recorded as **B-38** with what a safe version needs. The read-only half is
already built and reusable.

---

## Frozen, as required

`apps/pwa/public/index.html` — git hash `496199bd`, unmodified. The marketing
site is untouched; the console is a separate bundle on a separate page and a
school's device never downloads it.

**And it is no longer cached.** The tenant app's service worker controls the
whole origin, and `/platform.js` matched IMMUTABLE on its `.js` extension —
cache-first, pinning an operator to the first console build their browser ever
downloaded. That is the trap `/app.js` was pulled out of once already. A
console that suspends schools and records payments must not be one deploy
behind, and it has no offline story worth protecting, so it is network-only.

---

## §16 — the plan catalogue was the last SQL-only control

A school's plan could be changed from a screen. The plans it could be changed
*to* were seed rows editable only in `psql` — and a plan's price, student cap,
services and grace window are commercial state by any reading. Under this
phase's own gate that is disqualifying, so it is built: a third top-level tab,
create and edit, thirteen services each shown with what their absence does.

Three decisions worth recording:

- **The whole plan is submitted, never a patch.** A partial update of a price
  list is how a plan ends up carrying a new price and last year's services.
- **No DELETE, deliberately.** A plan with schools on it cannot be removed
  without orphaning them or cascading, and D17 says history is not destroyed.
  `is_active` takes a plan out of the picker and changes nothing for the
  schools already on it — the screen says so.
- **The blast radius is on the button.** Editing a plan moves every school on
  it at once, so the count is read before the change, and the confirmation
  repeats it.

And it found the **fourth** silent-zero-rows bug of the phase: the count of
affected schools read `FROM tenants` as the platform role, so it returned 0
while the screen correctly showed 2 — and wrote *"0 schools affected"* into
the audit trail. Through `app.platform_overview()` it is 2.

That is four occurrences of one root cause in one phase: **RLS returns an
empty result, not an error, and every layer above treats empty as an answer.**
`tenant_operations` (no policy), `tenants` in `/overview` (no bypass),
`UPDATE tenants SET student_cap` (no bypass), and this count. Worth stating as
a rule rather than four anecdotes: *any query the platform role runs outside a
tenant context must go through a SECURITY DEFINER function, and a zero it
returns must be assumed to be a lie until proven otherwise.*

---

## Two more defects the screens gave up under acceptance

**The institution headline said "সক্রিয়" over "কেউ প্রবেশ করতে পারছেন না".**
It was rendering `ops_state`, which is one of four inputs to the answer rather
than the answer. A school can be blocked by the legacy `tenants.status`, by
its bill, or by a closed portal while `ops_state` is still `active`. The card
now leads with what the school can actually do, and when the two disagree it
says so — because that is the fact that decides which control to reach for.

**The platform audit trail had an endpoint and no reader.** `GET
platform/audit` has served `audit.platform_access` since R-7 and nothing
opened it. An audit trail nobody can read is a record kept for a court case,
not a control. It is now a tab on every institution: what, why, when.

It does **not** say who, and that is not an oversight — see `B-39`. Platform
operator ids are JWT subjects with no `users` row behind them (843 audit rows
against one id here, and none of the five most active ids resolve to a
person). Printing the uuid would break "never expose raw UUIDs"; a truncated
one would look like an identity while being a fragment. So the column is
absent and the gap is written down.

---

## What P7 did NOT do, on purpose

- **No online payment gateway.** D16 says manual recording is the whole
  requirement at this business stage, and a gateway is separately approved.
- **No arbitrary execution surface.** No SQL editor, no HTML injection, no
  free-text anything that reaches a database or a page.
- **No deletion, anywhere in the console.** Suspension blocks access and
  preserves every row; `payment_receipts`, `ledger_entries` and
  `mfs_transactions` remain `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, so a school's financial
  history cannot be erased by erasing the school.
- **No commercial controls in `/demo`.** The demo is a separate surface and
  gained nothing from this phase.
- **No landing-page change.** `index.html` is byte-identical.

---

## §25/§26 — usage that is measured, not invented

The brief forbids faked telemetry, so the console counts only what the product
already records for its own reasons. Migration 057 adds one column to the
overview: **the later of a real sign-in (`user_sessions.issued_at`) and a real
product event (`product_events.occurred_at`)**. Sessions are revoked rather
than deleted on logout, so the maximum is a genuine last-sign-in and not a
last-still-logged-in.

That separates two failures the dashboard had been conflating:

| | What it means | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **অসম্পূর্ণ সেটআপ** | created, and never filled in | somebody stopped halfway through onboarding |
| **অনেকদিন কেউ ঢোকেনি** | set up properly, and not opened for 30 days | onboarded, invoiced, and not being used |

The second is the quieter and more expensive one, because nobody complains
about it. `NULL` is shown as **"কখনো নয়"** and never as a date.

The same pass fixed the master list's status column, which had the identity
card's bug: it rendered `ops_state`, so a school blocked by its legacy status,
its bill or a closed portal appeared as **সক্রিয়** in a list an operator scans
precisely to find trouble. It now shows the effective answer.

---

## What the attention queue learned

It was 45 rows over 37 schools on first run, and thirty of them said the same
thing. Three changes:

- **Ranked by how many people are stopped**, not by how alarming it sounds: a
  suspension is a total outage, an overdue bill still reads, a full roll stops
  only the next admission.
- **"Incomplete setup" expires.** After 30 days an empty school is not being
  onboarded; it is dormant, which is a dashboard COUNT and not a task for
  today. Unbounded, it buried the outages above it.
- **Bounded at 20 rows**, with the remainder stated rather than dropped —
  past that an operator is scrolling, not working, and the rows below the fold
  are by construction the least urgent.

---

## The one measurement that justifies where the gate went

`withTenant` takes an optional `write: true`, which refuses a read-only school
early — before the handler does work it will throw away. It is an
optimisation.

**No endpoint in the repository passes it.** Zero of them:

```
$ grep -rn "write: true" services/*/api/*.ts | wc -l
0
```

And a POST to `/api/v1/ops/notices` against a school in maintenance is still
refused, 403, with the operator's own sentence — because
`SET LOCAL transaction_read_only = on` is applied by the gate and PostgreSQL
raises SQLSTATE 25006 on the write, which `inTx` translates back into the same
refusal.

That is the whole argument for putting this in `withTenant` rather than in
109 handlers, stated as a fact rather than a preference: **the guarantee holds
with no endpoint cooperating at all**, including the endpoints written after
this phase by someone who never reads this file.

---

## §27 — the cross-institution feed, and §35 — the thing not built

**§27 is closed with the trail that already existed.** `GET platform/audit`
without a tenant filter has served the cross-institution view since R-7 and
nothing read it. The dashboard now shows the last twelve platform actions —
when, which school (or "সব প্রতিষ্ঠান" for a plan change, which belongs to no
one school), the operator's own reason, and what changed. Same rows, no second
pipeline.

While wiring it, `readAudit` stopped shipping `actorId` to the client at all.
It is a JWT subject with no `users` row behind it, so it resolves to nobody,
cannot be displayed under "never expose raw UUIDs", and sending it only
invites the next person to render it. The column stays in
`audit.platform_access`, where it is evidence rather than a field.

**§35 bulk operations are NOT built, and that is a decision rather than an
oversight** (`B-40`). Every control here acts on one school, names its
consequence and is confirmed individually. The bulk version's most natural use
— suspend these eleven — is the most destructive action the product can take,
and the phase that built the console is the wrong phase to add an untested
many-school mutation to at the end of. Nothing becomes SQL-only as a result:
every school can be operated from its own screen. The backlog row records the
shape a safe version would have to take.

---

## The second flake: a test that made itself the attacker

P6's rule — *do not call a test green because it passed once* — earned its keep
twice in this phase. The second time, `platform-svc` passed, passed, and
failed on the third consecutive run:

```
run 1: 35 pass    run 2: 35 pass    run 3: 34 pass, 1 fail
  {"error":"rate_limited", "retryAfterSec":165}   ← then 134, then 102, then 70
```

The countdown across runs is the whole diagnosis. Activation redemption is
rate-limited as `otp_verify` — **10 per hour, keyed on the device** — and the
suite redeemed with a constant `deviceId: 'r7-test-device'`. Every run of the
suite spent from the *same* bucket, so the fifth run in an hour was refused by
a security control that was working exactly as designed. The test had
accidentally made itself the attacker.

The fix is a device id per run. It does not weaken the limit — that is
asserted in `packages/server-core`'s rate-limit suite and again by
`scripts/security-probe.mjs`; here it was deciding the outcome of a test about
onboarding. **Five consecutive runs now pass** where the third used to fail.

Same family as B-35 (fixed uuids shared across runs), one layer up: a constant
in a test is a shared resource whenever the thing it keys is shared.

The first flake was worse and is described above — a `before` hook that threw,
an `after` that threw on the same broken state, and a lock connection that
kept the process alive so nothing was ever released.

**Neither was a flaky test.** One was a wedged process holding a lock; the
other was a real limiter refusing a real burst. Both looked like flakiness,
and both had a cause that could be found and removed.

---

## §8 — a refusal that had never once run

`setService` refuses to switch a service off while something depending on it
is still on. Good code. It had **never executed**: the seeded catalogue
declares no dependencies at all — 051 shipped `documents` depending on
`documents_source`, a code that does not exist, and cleared it two statements
later with the comment *"the sort of thing a catalogue should not be able to
say"*. It fixed the one instance and left the next one possible.

That matters because of the shape of the failure. The refusal is

```sql
SELECT c.code FROM service_catalogue c WHERE $2 = ANY(c.depends_on) …
```

A dangling code never matches, so it raises nothing — it silently makes the
refusal stop firing. Same shape as everything else in this phase: no error, no
rows, no protection.

**Migration 058** makes the catalogue unable to say it: a dangling dependency,
a self-dependency and a two-service cycle are all refused at write time, and
the migration re-validates the rows already there rather than installing a
guard that only applies to future ones. Longer cycles are deliberately not
checked — a graph walk on every write of a thirteen-row table nobody edits at
runtime would cost more than the mistake.

**And the refusal now has tests that actually reach it.** They declare a
dependency for the length of the test and take it away again, which tests the
mechanism without inventing a product rule: there is no honest hard dependency
among the current thirteen services, and asserting a fabricated one so the
code has something to bite would be asserting a fiction. `reports` analysing
already-published results keeps working with `results` switched off, which is
why it is *not* declared as depending on it.

The catalogue's dependency column is therefore **empty on purpose**, the guard
is real, and the refusal is proven.

---

## The last inconsistency: one suspension button that did not ask why

Fourteen POST routes on the console; eight demanded a written reason. Of the
six that did not, five are R-7 onboarding steps — creating a school,
provisioning it, branding it, adding its first admin, importing a roster —
which are creation acts, not changes to a running school, and all of them
audit a descriptive line anyway.

The sixth was `/status`, and it mattered: **052 made the gate honour
`tenants.status`**, so what used to be a column nobody read is now a real
suspension that locks a whole school out. The one endpoint that could do that
was the one that did not have to explain itself.

It does now, on the server and on R-7's screen, with a field that sits beside
the buttons rather than in a dialogue after them. Every dangerous act in this
console now carries a sentence a person wrote.

---

## Gate

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Full suite | **1,565 passing**, 0 failing, 12 workspaces — run **twice** |
| `platform-svc` specifically | **40 tests**, run **five consecutive times** after the rate-limit flake was diagnosed |
| `tenant-gate.test.ts` | **33 tests** — suspension, maintenance, limited, billing derivation, portals, services, isolation, fail-closed, skipGate |
| TypeScript — all three CI configs | 0 errors |
| Typecheck drift guard | passed; baseline 65 → **66** (the new icon-name test) |
| Build | `app.js` + `sw.js` + 11 API bundles |
| Migrations | **58/58**, fully migrated, 58 rollback files |
| `scripts/security-probe.mjs` | **28 of 29 pass**, 0 fail, 1 skipped for a stated reason (OTP disabled on this deployment) |
| `index.html` | git hash `496199bd` — **unchanged** |
| Console bundle separation (D11) | `app.js` contains no console code — checked for five markers |
| Raw UUIDs in the console | **0**, across three top-level views and all six drawer tabs |
| Desktop 1024 / 1280 / 1440 / 1600 | no horizontal overflow, no target under 24×24 |
| Mobile 360 / 375 / 390 | no overflow; the table becomes the mobile list |
| Light + dark | worst measured contrast **8.00:1** in dark at 1280 (AA needs 4.5) |
| Theme toggle | pins the choice, persists, and its label flips |

### The commercial gate, item by item

> *"No commercial state may be achievable only by SQL."*

Institution state · service state · portal state · plan assignment · **the
plan catalogue itself** · student cap · payments · grace. All have screens.

> *"No important service control may exist only as a backend switch without an
> operator UI."*

All thirteen services are on one screen with what turning each off does.

> *"No dangerous platform action may exist without explanation, confirmation
> and audit."*

Every mutation states its consequence, demands a reason of at least three
characters, confirms inside the surface that raised it, and writes
`audit.platform_access` carrying the operator's own sentence. The last
exception — `/status`, the legacy suspension — was closed in this pass.

**Commit:** `c5ab9d0`.

# P8 — final legacy cleanup, consistency and release hardening   (2026-09-02) · **COMPLETE**

A cleanup phase that found seven live defects, because the way to know whether
code is obsolete is to look at what it actually does.

---

## The inventory (§1)

Eight dimensions audited read-only in parallel, then **every removability
claim handed to a separate agent whose instructions were to prove it wrong**.

| | |
|---|---|
| Items inventoried | **164** |
| Claimed safe to remove | 56 |
| **Survived refutation** | **24** |
| **REFUTED — would have broken something** | **16** |

Those sixteen are the phase's best argument for the second pass. Among them:
`bnNum`, `BULK_CAPABLE` and `smsCostHintBn` are each imported by a CI-executed
test (a test is a real consumer); `ix_blocks_lesson` is named by a later
forward migration; `v_default_partition_leakage` has documented consumers; and
two `bnDate` copies look identical but feed different input shapes, so the
proposed shared replacement *crashes one screen and prints raw timestamps on
the other*. Every one of those would have been a confident, evidenced,
wrong deletion.

One refutation was about the auditor's own conduct and it was right: files
were edited while the read-only inventory was still running, which shifted
every `app.css` line number after 195 by one. The audit's findings hold; its
line references for that file need the offset.

---

## The defect the phase was really about

**A calendar day in this product is a day in Bangladesh, and three of the four
layers were reading UTC.**

Observed live rather than reasoned about:

```
TimeZone                                  Etc/UTC
now()                                     2026-09-01 23:17:22+00
CURRENT_DATE                              2026-09-01
(now() AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Dhaka')::date   2026-09-02
```

The database and the person disagreed, **for six hours of every day** —
18:00–24:00 UTC, which is midnight to 6am in Bangladesh. Not unusual hours: an
IT admin importing a roster the night before term, a teacher checking tomorrow's
routine before bed, a receipt printed at half past midnight.

Proven on real data before anything was changed:

```
grace_until                    2026-09-01   (yesterday, in Dhaka)
'2026-09-01' >= CURRENT_DATE   → true       "still in grace"
'2026-09-01' >= dhaka_today    → false      "grace has ended"
```

### Why it was still there

It had been found and fixed **twice**, at the two layers above:

- `packages/server-core/src/time.ts` — `dhakaToday()`, whose header says
  *"the same trap is reachable from every service that defaults a date, and
  two of them had already reached it"*
- `packages/ui-core/src/format.ts` — `todayLocalIso()`, added in P7 after the
  same bug surfaced on a payment form

Two helpers existed to stop it. Nobody had looked at the database, which is
where most of the dates come from.

### What P8 changed

| Layer | Sites | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Database functions | 6 functions, 14 comparisons | migration **059** → `app.today_dhaka()` |
| Database column defaults | **19 columns** | migration **059** |
| SQL embedded in TypeScript | **31 sites, 15 files** | `app.today_dhaka()` |
| Server JavaScript | 3 (`myroutine`, `assign`, `document`) | `dhakaToday()` |
| Browser JavaScript | 3 (`routine-view`, `substitute-view`, `teacher-home-view`) | `todayLocalIso()` |

`document.ts` was the one worth wincing at: `issuedOn` on a printed
certificate, dated to the day before for anything issued after midnight.

Migration 059's function bodies are the LIVE definitions from
`pg_get_functiondef`, changed in exactly one way, with the substitution count
asserted per function — because the first draft of that migration rewrote
`commit_rollover` from memory and invented a four-argument signature, dropped
its refusal to run with blocked students, and dropped the
`derive_student_subjects` call that gives a promoted child the right subjects.
None of that shows up in a diff of a body you retyped.

**`ALTER DATABASE … SET timezone` was considered and rejected as the
mechanism.** It would fix everything at once and it is worth setting as well —
but it is a configuration a new environment can be brought up without, and it
fails silently when missing. Correctness that depends on a setting somebody
must remember is not correctness.

---

## §8 — the four boundary dates, walked

| Case | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| due TODAY (Dhaka) | active | **active** ✓ |
| due YESTERDAY | grace_period | **grace_period** ✓ |
| grace ends TODAY | grace_period | **grace_period** ✓ |
| grace ended YESTERDAY | grace_period ✗ | **limited** ✓ |

The fourth exposed a second, separate bug. The explicit grant had expired, but
the plan's own 14-day window had not, so the fallback clause silently extended
the school six more days. The clause's own comment says it applies *"if the
plan carries grace days **and none was recorded**"* — and the code never
checked that second half.

The consequence was a half-inert control: the console's grace field could only
ever push grace *later* than the plan default. An operator deciding "until the
first, and no longer" was overruled by a default and told the change had
worked. **Migration 060** makes an explicit `grace_until` authoritative while
it is set — it may extend the plan's window or cut it short, because a person
looked at this school and decided.

Eight boundary tests now pin all of it, and the suite's own `daysFromNow`
helper was counting from the UTC date — invisible at an offset of -400 and
decisive at 0.

---

## §12 — the schema lint had been failing since P7

Nobody had run it. Four problems, all P7's:

```
L1 plans:              no tenant_id column and not in the exempt list
L1 service_catalogue:  no tenant_id column and not in the exempt list
L2 tenant_operations:  RLS enabled=t forced=f  (both must be true)
L2 tenant_payments:    RLS enabled=t forced=f
```

**L2 is the one that mattered.** `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` does not apply to
a table's owner; every other tenant-scoped table in this schema also carries
`FORCE`, so that no role — not even the one migrations run as — can read
across schools by accident. `tenant_operations` holds every school's
operational state and `tenant_payments` holds every payment ever recorded, and
they were the only two tenant tables in the product without it. Migration
**061** closes it and proves the change rather than trusting the statement.

L1 was a declaration the lint was right to demand: `plans` and
`service_catalogue` are platform-global reference data, like
`subject_catalogue` beside them, and a table with no `tenant_id` is either
deliberate or serious — the only way to tell is for somebody to say which.

**Migration 062** drops two indexes that duplicate the UNIQUE index beside
them on identical columns (`ix_practice_options`, `ix_blocks_topic`). A unique
btree answers every query a non-unique one on the same columns answers; what
the duplicate did was cost a write on every insert into two bulk-written
tables. The `CREATE INDEX` statements in migrations 017 and 019 are left
exactly as they are — a migration records what happened, and editing one so a
replay skips a step is how a fresh database stops matching a migrated one.

---

## §2/§3 — the design system

**491 lines of dead CSS removed.** 123 class selectors that no source file, no
test, no HTML page and no BUILT bundle ever names — whole screen-local
families (`fees-*`, `ledger-*`, `ward-card*`, `result-card*`, `script-*`,
`lesson-*`, `more-*`, `sub-*`, `system-*`, `recon-*`, `iso-*`, `role-*`,
`batch-*`) left behind when P2–P6 rebuilt those screens on the `ui-*`
primitives.

Verified three ways before deleting, because CSS has no error for a missing
rule: an independent re-scan (123 against the audit's 128, the gap being
dynamic `is-`/`tab-` prefixes I excluded); a check that every removed selector
contains at least one dead class, since a compound selector cannot match when
any of its classes is never applied; and a check that the rewrite ADDED
nothing but whitespace. Then **25 routes across three roles** driven in a
browser: all render, none overflow, including `#/scripts` and `#/substitute`.

`app.css`: **3,926 → 3,850 lines, 219.6 KB → 204.0 KB raw, 53.0 → 51.2 KB
gzipped.**

The rebuilt screens kept a handful of their own class names —
`result-footnote`, `ward-cta`, `lesson-reader` — and not one of those appeared
in the dead list. That is the sharpest evidence the scan cut at the right
granularity.

### A live defect inside the token system

Four rules read `var(--lh-normal)`. **That token is defined nowhere**, so the
browser dropped all four `line-height` declarations and the elements
inherited. Measured before the fix: `.perf-q-stem` computed 26.25px on a 15px
font — 1.75, the inherited value, not the 1.65 the rule asked for. At the same
time the entire `--lh-*` ramp had **zero** readers: it was authored, and then
every rule was written against a name outside it.

It survived because `design-tokens.test.ts` only scanned `--c-` and
`--color-`. Every other family — `--lh-`, `--text-`, `--space-`, `--radius-`,
`--shadow-` — was unguarded. One prefix now covers all of them, and the guard
was proved to fail on a planted `var(--lh-does-not-exist)` before being
trusted.

### Not a duplicate system, and said so

`--c-*` (30 tokens, 721 uses) turned out to be **aliases** of `--color-*` —
all 30 resolve as `var(--color-…)`. One system with a compatibility layer, not
two competing ones, so §3's "remove only confirmed zero-usage items" leaves it
standing. `--c-primary-flat` was the single orphan: defined once, written
twice by the tenant-branding runtime, read by nothing. Removed from all three
places.

Two genuine duplications are **recorded and not removed**, because both halves
are live: `.data-table`/`.table-scroll` (10 hand-built call sites) beside
`.ui-table` (19 via `dataTable()`), which are not visually equivalent — 14px
right-aligned against 13px end-aligned, and `my-attendance-view` and
`students-view` each render BOTH; and `.card` (62 sites) beside `.ui-card`
(23 modules), near-identical bodies differing only in padding. Converting the
call sites is the fix; deleting CSS is not. Recorded as `B-41`.

---

## §21 — a number in a Bangla sentence

Twelve strings across nine files counted in Latin digits inside Bangla prose,
and two were **accessible names that disagreed with the pixels beside them**:
the unread bell painted "৩" and announced "3"; the count badge did the same;
`practice-view` said "কঠিনতা 3 / ৫", the child's score in one script and the
maximum in the other, in one phrase.

**Three separate tests were found asserting the defect** — `notice.test.ts`
pinned `/2/` and `/200/`, `ui-core.test.ts` pinned `'নোটিশ — 3'`, and
`search.ts` carries a comment recording that this same class of bug was found
and fixed once before. A test that pins the wrong half passes for exactly as
long as the bug lives.

`bangla-numerals.test.ts` now looks for the pattern instead: a Latin digit
feeding a Bangla counter (`টি`, `জন`, …) is unambiguous, while a bare Latin
digit near Bangla is not and is deliberately NOT flagged — R-8 decided money
and identifiers stay Latin. Its self-check caught a bug in its own regex on
the first run (`\b` is an ASCII word boundary and never matches after a Bangla
character), and a second on CRLF checkouts (`.` excludes `\r`, so the comment
stripper matched nothing and reported two comments as defects).

---

## Duplicate helpers, consolidated

- **four** byte-identical private "convert to Bangla digits" functions inside
  `apps/pwa/src/ui/` alone — `badge`, `filter`, `table`, `upload` — now
  `toBanglaDigits`
- **three** identical exported `todayBn` copies, one per home view, each with
  its own weekday and month tables beside it, now `weekdayDateBn` in ui-core.
  `home-view`'s fourth copy stays: it uses the SHORT weekday ("রবি") because a
  hero line has to fit, so it is a different string rather than a duplicate
- **three** `todayIso()` copies, **two of them the UTC bug** on a teacher's
  routine and substitute screens; the third had the comment explaining exactly
  that hazard and was the only one that got it right

Six dead exports removed — `pageSkeleton`, `tableId`, `otpLoginAnswered`,
`slotLabel`, `CODE_TTL_HOURS`, plus two unused imports. Each carried a comment
naming a consumer that does not exist: `slotLabel` says "exported for the
shell's route", and the shell does not import it.

---

## §7/§6 — a colour picker that erased a school's identity

The console's branding endpoint wrote

```sql
jsonb_set(settings, '{branding}', <only the keys in this request>)
```

and `jsonb_set` REPLACES. Observed on a real tenant: setting only
`primaryColor` left `{"primaryColor": "#0d47a1"}` and destroyed the school's
name, English name, short name and logo — the whole white-label identity, from
a colour picker.

`services/ops-svc/api/branding.ts`, the SCHOOL's own editor, had it right all
along and says so in its header: *"a future caller sending only
{ primaryColor } must not blank the school's address, logo and headmaster as a
side effect."* The console reimplemented the rule instead of reusing it. One
rule, two implementations, one of them wrong.

The existing test checked the placeholder half of the rule and not this half,
which is why it passed throughout.

---

## §9 — the skipped security probe, resolved

P7 left `scripts/security-probe.mjs` at **28 of 29, one skipped**: "repeated
OTP requests are refused before they become a bill" could not run, because the
feature gate answers 503 before the limiter is ever reached. Turning
`OTP_SENDING_ENABLED` on in the local acceptance harness lets the probe reach
it — no SMS leaves the machine, because `SMS_PROVIDER` is unset and the
dispatcher queues and stops.

**29 of 29, 0 failed, 0 skipped.**

It stays recorded as `rehearsed` rather than `verified`: production has 0
tenants, so a two-tenant isolation probe cannot run there. That is an external
dependency (`B-5`), and `docs/production-evidence.json` already said so
precisely.

---

## §18 — an instruction an operator reads at 2am

`packages/server-core/src/alerts.ts` told whoever is paged for an SMS outage
to `GET /api/v1/ops/health`. **That endpoint does not exist**, on any host —
following it returns `404 {"error":"not_found"}`, which reads as "the whole
thing is down" during exactly the incident where that inference is most
expensive. The real endpoint is `GET /api/v1/platform/health?id=<tenant>`, and
it needs both platform credentials. Fixed in the alert text and in the two
places `docs/12-PRODUCTION-RUNBOOK.md` repeats it.

`shikhonbd.com` replaced with `sikhon.systems` in **24 places across 13
files** — including two operator-facing Bangla strings telling somebody to
configure DNS for a domain the company does not serve, and the VAPID `sub`
claim, which is a real value in a real protocol that goes to a push service.
Documentation keeps its historical references, per D17.

A test pinned the old domain too, under the name *"the contact is the PLATFORM,
never a school (D11)"*. It now asserts that property — a reachable mailbox on a
bare apex, never a per-school subdomain — instead of a literal that had quietly
become a record of a stale default.

---

## §5/§11 — session, cache and offline, verified rather than assumed

Nothing needed changing here, and that is worth recording with the evidence
rather than as a claim.

**Logout was already right.** `purgeLocalData()` deletes every Cache API cache
and sweeps the `shikhon_*` localStorage tiers, in that order, and its comment
explains why the order is the whole point: sweeping storage first gives a
resolved `authedFetch` a turn, and a screen's entire job on resolving is to
write what it received into its cache — so the last screen the previous user
had open quietly re-cached itself into an already-swept store. `sweepNow()`
runs synchronously beside the reload to close even the microtask gap. The
offline outbox (IndexedDB) is deliberately NOT touched, and the file asserts
that by grepping itself for `deleteDatabase`.

**Cache contents, read out of a live browser:**

```
shikhon-shell-v2   /app  /offline  /app.css  /app.js  /icons/icon.svg
                   /manifest.webmanifest  + versioned font and CDN assets
shikhon-data-v1    /api/v1/ops/brand
```

- `/` is **not** cached — the marketing site never becomes the app shell
- `/platform*` is **not** cached — P7 made the console network-only
- no `shikhon-shell-v1`, so the version bump pruned cleanly

**Offline, with the server actually stopped:**

| Request | Result |
|---|---|
| `/app` | **serves from the SW** — shell, title and `#root` all present |
| `/` | **fails** — correct: network-only, so the SW must not substitute the app |
| `/platform` | **fails** — correct: an operator console must never be stale |

Two apparent findings were investigated and both were benign. `/app.js`
appeared four times in one cache under different `?v=` query strings — that
token is injected by `.claude/static-server.mjs` for local cache-busting and
`app.html` ships bare paths, so production stores exactly one entry. And the
`fonts.gstatic.com` / `unpkg.com` entries cached cache-first are version-
addressed URLs, where cache-first is the correct policy rather than a leak.

---

## §7 — the platform controls, re-tested against two schools

Eleven acts on school A, with school B read before and after:

```
maintenance · limited · suspended · active
portal close · portal open
service disable · service enable
student cap · grace period · payment
                                     all 200
```

```
B before:  mohammadpur-college|pilot|600|active|{}|{}||0
B after:   mohammadpur-college|pilot|600|active|{}|{}||0
```

Byte-identical. Plan, cap, ops state, services, portals, grace and payment
count all unchanged on the school that was not touched.

---

## §22 — the browser matrix, risk-based

The brief permits a risk-based matrix over a Cartesian product, so here is
exactly what was driven and why.

**Layout risk lives at the breakpoints**, so every width was measured:
360 · 375 · 390 · 640 · 768 · 1024 · 1280 · 1440 · 1600.
**Contrast risk is token-level, not width-level**, so both themes were
measured at two widths rather than eighteen.
**Content-shape risk is per role**, so all roles were driven through their own
routes at one desktop and one phone width.

| Surface | What was driven | Result |
|---|---|---|
| tenant app | 9 widths light, 4 widths dark | no horizontal overflow anywhere; worst contrast 4.51 light / 5.01 dark |
| tenant app, per role | 25 routes across teacher, student and guardian | every route renders with real content; none overflow |
| platform console | 390 · 1024 · 1280, light and dark | no overflow; worst contrast 4.77 (white on the brand red, which app.css documents as 4.77:1) |
| demo | 1280 light | white-labelled, role picker present, banner present |

Every page-state was also checked for `undefined`, `NaN`, `null`,
`[object Object]`, a raw UUID, an unnamed control, and a Latin digit feeding a
Bangla counter — in the visible text AND in every `aria-label`, `title`,
`placeholder` and `alt`. **Zero occurrences of any of them**, including across
all three top-level console views and all six drawer tabs.

The worst light-theme reading, 4.51 against a 4.5 requirement, passes by 0.01
and is recorded here so the next person who moves a token knows how little
room there is.

---

## §19 and §20 — the two things not built, classified

**B-38 support mode → POST-PILOT.** Not a pilot blocker. A pilot is a handful
of schools whose staff are reachable by phone, and the support question a
pilot raises is answered by the console — institution state, services,
portals, billing, audit — plus a call. Impersonation earns its risk at the
scale where support cannot ring the head teacher. The technical blocker is
unchanged and specific: 18 RLS policies key off `app.current_user_id()` or
`app.my_section_ids()`, so a support session would render a *different screen*
from the one being reported, which is worse than none.

**B-40 bulk operations → POST-PILOT, with a stated trigger.** §20 asks whether
the current institution count justifies it. It does not: the console lists 62
schools in a development database and **0 in production**. The trigger is
roughly **50 real institutions**, or the first time one commercial change must
reach more than about ten schools in a sitting — a term-boundary invoice run
being the likely first. Until then the risk is one-sided: the natural first
bulk action is suspension, and a mis-selected bulk suspend is the most
destructive thing this product can do.

---

## §13 — the test harness

B-35's advisory lock is kept. It is the right mechanism: session-scoped, so a
killed process releases it, which a lock table would not. P7 added `unref()`
so a suite that dies badly cannot hold it forever, and `asBootstrap()` so
fixture setup can create the school the gate would otherwise refuse.

What P8 adds is the observation that **four DB-backed suites are outside the
fence** — `academics-svc/test/api.test.ts` and the three `rms-svc` solver
suites either import the lock helper without taking it or do not import it at
all, while writing the same shared database as the 27 suites that do. They
have not been observed to fail, which is precisely the property B-35 warns
about: the failure mode is a scatter of assertion errors with no common cause,
not a clean break. Recorded as `B-43` rather than fixed, because bringing them
inside the fence changes how long the suite takes and wants its own pass.

**Reproducibility, measured:** the full suite was run twice back-to-back at the
end of this phase, and `platform-svc` five consecutive times when P7's
rate-limit flake was diagnosed.

---

## Gate

| Check | Result |
|---|---|

### Four defects that shipped, and the guard each one now has

Every guard was proved to fail on a planted defect before being trusted, and
two of them found a bug in their own first implementation.

| Shipped | Guard |
|---|---|
| a UTC date read as a calendar day, six times over four layers | `calendar-dates.test.ts` |
| a Latin digit inside a Bangla sentence, three times | `bangla-numerals.test.ts` |
| a glyph name that does not exist, twice (P5 → P8) | `icon-names.test.ts` |
| a design token used but never defined, in an unguarded family | `design-tokens.test.ts`, widened to all families |

The pattern is the same in all four: the bug had already been found and fixed
at least once, a comment or a helper was left behind to prevent the next one,
and nothing looked. A comment is not a control.

**Commit:** `c5a6256`.

# P-pilot-hardening — the six MUST items, and the four defects found on the way   (2026-09-02) · **PARTIAL**

Report-only audit accepted; this phase closes what it can and says plainly
what it cannot. **PARTIAL, not COMPLETE**: three of the six MUST items depend
on things that do not exist yet — an aggregator contract, a DNS record, and a
webhook pointing at a person — and no amount of code closes those.

## M1 — a deactivated account loses access

The audit proved, against a running stack, that deactivation did nothing:
plant a refresh session for a real principal, set the row to `left`, call
`/api/v1/auth/refresh`, and receive **200 with a fresh principal-role token**.
Refresh rotates, so the session never aged out — a dismissed teacher with the
app installed kept working access indefinitely.

Three auth doors call `loadRoles`. `activate` and `otp-verify` checked
`users.status` first; `refresh` did not. So the check moved into the function
all three already call, where the next door cannot forget it — the same
argument P7 made for putting the tenant gate inside `withTenant`. `refresh`
keeps its own check as well, deliberately duplicated, **for the message**:
"account is left" tells the office what happened, where "no active role
assigned" sends them hunting through role assignments for a problem that is
not there.

`invited` stays allowed beside `active`, because that is the rule the two
correct callers already applied: `otp-verify` admits an invited user without
promoting them, and refusing it here would end their session fifteen minutes
after they logged in.

Deactivation now also revokes live sessions in the same transaction and
records how many in the audit row. Blocking the next refresh is not the same
as signing somebody out.

**Each layer was reverted on its own and the matching test went red:**

| Layer removed | What happened |
|---|---|
| the `refresh` status check | still 403 — but degraded to `no_active_role`, which is the argument for keeping it |
| the `loadRoles` filter | the shared-door test failed; the endpoints held |
| the session revocation | three tests failed |

`scripts/m1-deactivation-probe.mjs` re-runs the audit's experiment over real
HTTP against `deploy/server.mjs`. On the pre-M1 code it prints the 200 and the
decoded principal token; on this commit it returns 403 `account_not_active`.

## M6 — the register the substitute finder had been waiting for since 006

The substitute finder refuses to offer an absent teacher. So does the
invigilator ranker. Both read `teacher_leaves` and `teacher_availability`, and
**nothing in the product has ever written to either** — one grep hit
repo-wide, and it is a test fixture. Real filters, tested, inert: on a live
school the finder would cheerfully propose the teacher everybody knows is at
a funeral.

Migration 063 adds `teacher_attendance` — one row per teacher per day, three
states, an optional line of text. `present` is recorded rather than inferred,
because "nobody has marked today" and "everyone was here" are different facts.
Not leave management, not payroll, no approval chain; `teacher_leaves` is left
exactly as it is for the day that is actually wanted.

`app.teacher_absent_on()` is the single definition of away and both readers
call it. Pasting a fourth `NOT EXISTS` into two places is how P8's calendar
bug survived being fixed twice.

**The ranker's body was regenerated from `pg_get_functiondef` with the one
substitution asserted — and the first draft, assembled from a partial quote of
migration 030 plus memory, had invented a different `RETURNS TABLE`, returned
quietly instead of raising on a missing hall, and dropped the computation of
the session end from the longest paper. It would have applied cleanly.** That
is migration 059's rule paying for itself a second time.

The screen — শিক্ষক হাজিরা — has a date, the staff list, and three buttons a
row. No save button: each button POSTs on press and the row renders what the
**server** returned, because a register showing a mark that failed is worse
than one showing nothing. Driven in a browser against the real API as a
principal: five teachers, one marked absent with a reason, the row and the
counts moved, both themes, and at 375px where the table collapses to cards.

## The three defects nobody was looking for

Same shape the audit named, and the reason each survived is the same: nothing
ran the thing that would have caught it.

**1. `app.set_guardian_permissions` has raised an error on every call since
migration 050.** 050 made the `guardianships` unique index partial
(`WHERE revoked_at IS NULL`) and left the function inferring it with a bare
column list. PostgreSQL will not infer a partial index that way. That is the
whole guardian-link path — adding a guardian, changing a relation, moving
`is_primary`, and setting the `receives_sms` / `can_pay_fees` flags that decide
who receives the absence SMS. **Production is on 048 and still works; it would
have broken the moment the M2 catch-up ran 049–062.** Migration 064 repairs it,
and also scopes the primary-demotion to live rows so it stops rewriting revoked
history.

**2. The substitute finder's candidate query has never worked.** It passes
`slotId` as `$1` and never references it, so PostgreSQL refuses the statement:
*could not determine data type of parameter $1*. Every call was a 500. Nothing
caught it because `rms-svc` had no substitute test at all — the feature the
audit named as M6's consumer had zero coverage. `$2..$6` renumbered, and the
M6 suite is now its regression test.

**3. Why both survived: `npm test` never ran `db/tests/*.sql`.** Twenty-six SQL
suites, invisible to the command every phase used to declare itself green.
Three of them had been failing since 050. And the same failure twice more in
CI: `database.yml` named the suites by hand and **13 of the 26 had never run
there**, and its rollback step globbed `*.down.sql`, a suffix dropped at 049,
so **every rollback file from 049 onward had never been executed**. Its "left N
objects" assertion still passed, because rolling back 001 cascades the later
tables away regardless.

All three are now directory loops that cannot drift, and `test-all.mjs` runs
the SQL suites — the script whose opening line is "fail loudly if a workspace
has tests that nothing runs".

Also closed: **B-43**, which the audit could only record as risk #13. Five
suites imported `lockFixtures`, never called it, and called `unlockFixtures`
in `after` — a no-op on a lock never taken — so they ran unfenced beside every
other DB suite. It surfaced here as one rms file reporting 57 tests where 62
were expected, no test named, then three clean runs on its own. All five
fenced, and `fixture-fencing.test.ts` checks the rule at source level, because
re-running cannot prove it.

## M2, M3, M4, M5 — what was established, and what is still missing

**M2 — procedure written and rehearsed, not run.** `docs/13-MIGRATION-CATCHUP.md`.
Its section 0 is the finding above: 049–063 must not be left applied without
064, so the range is one unit of work and a failure goes back to 048.
Rehearsed locally: 64 migrations apply silently to an empty database, 26/26 SQL
suites pass twice leaving zero rows, and up then down then up over all 63
rollback files leaves zero objects in `public` and re-applies clean. Production
is not reachable from here.

**M3 — verified, and it is not what was assumed.** `*.sikhon.systems` is
NXDOMAIN. Arbitrary labels do not resolve on 8.8.8.8 and `curl` agrees. A first
pass through the local ISP resolver looked like a wildcard; that was `nslookup`
printing the RESOLVER's own address, not an answer — worth recording, because
it is exactly the kind of reading that produces "DNS is configured". The apex
and `www` resolve to 200.234.43.179 and serve valid TLS. **Both code paths
already exist** (`tenantKeyFromHost`, and `app.public_branding()` resolving a
slug or a tenant id to the same row, with `?tid=` keeping priority so installed
PWAs are never overridden). This is a DNS record and a DNS-01 wildcard
certificate, not product work. **Owner decision.**

**M4 — external blocker, untouched.** No aggregator contract, no credentials.
The fake-aggregator tests were left exactly as they were, as instructed. The
seam and the SSL Wireless adapter exist; unset, the stub is used, and
`SMS_PROVIDER` named without credentials throws rather than pretending.

**M5 — pipeline proved, destination missing.** `scripts/alert-rehearsal.mjs`,
7/7. It boots the real monitor endpoint with `DATABASE_MAINTENANCE_URL` on a
closed port, so `database_unavailable` is **evaluated, not injected**; GET
returns the alert and delivers nothing, POST delivers, and a real HTTPS
listener receives the POST 21ms later carrying the alert id, severity,
environment and the runbook's recover text. Recorded as `rehearsed`, never
`verified`: the listener was local and self-signed, and no message reached a
person.

## Verified read-only against production

- It serves the frozen landing page **byte-identical at `496199bd`**.
- The pre-auth brand endpoint returns the generic signboard for an unknown
  slug, with `tenantId: null` and no school list — D12 holding.
- `ops/staff-attendance` is **404**, which is the check that will say whether
  the migrations went out without the code.
- The deployed revision could not be established from outside. `platform/*`
  answers 403 before route lookup, and no `ops/*` route dates P7 or P8.

## One pilot fix

A guardian's phone number on the admin student drawer is now a `tel:` anchor
with a 48px target and an aria-label naming who is being rung. No server
change and **deliberately no client-side role check**: `ops/guardians` already
returns the number to three roles and `phone: null` to everyone else, so the
number's presence *is* the authorization, and a second copy of that rule on
the client would be free to drift. Verified both ways against the running
stack.

## What is still open

- The seven `ui-` class names referenced in `apps/pwa/src` and absent from
  `app.css`. A class that does not exist fails silently — two of my own cost a
  mis-rendered summary row this phase. Recorded in BACKLOG rather than
  baselined: each needs a look, and a baseline of seven unexamined entries is
  how a guard rots.
- The SHOULD list's other items were not built: the guardian today's-status
  card, the principal absent-trend, and receipt serials. Named here so the
  omission is a decision on the record rather than a gap somebody finds later.

# Final Owner-Level SaaS Operations Audit   (2026-09-02) · **REPORT ONLY**

No schema, API, UI or landing-page change. Full report:
[FINAL-OWNER-SAAS-OPERATIONS-AUDIT.md](FINAL-OWNER-SAAS-OPERATIONS-AUDIT.md).

**Method.** 30 investigating agents across the owner's 22 areas, a runtime entitlement probe
that created tenants in each lifecycle state and made real HTTP calls, six adversarial passes
instructed to *refute* the highest-stakes claims, and a completeness critic. Every
verdict-changing claim was then re-verified by hand. The adversarial pass earned its place:
it overturned four survey conclusions, including one that would have told the owner service
disable was airtight.

## The finding that outranks everything else

**A freshly provisioned school cannot run a term.** Four workflows have no writer anywhere:

| Workflow | Writers in production code | In `app.*` SQL functions | Rows across 112 tenants |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create an exam | 0 | 0 | 5 (fixtures) |
| Set a fee amount | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| Create a routine | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| Create a room | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| Record a payment | 1 (MFS webhook only) | — | 1 |

Verified by hand, not only by agents. The consequence: a school onboards, imports students
and takes attendance — then stops. The exam → grade → GPA → rank → publish chain is fully
built, tested and **unreachable**, because no exam can be created. The monthly invoice run
joins `fee_structures` and therefore yields zero invoices forever.

None of the four appears in `docs/BACKLOG.md`, the file its own header calls "the only
backlog". They are now B-46 … B-49.

## Three findings that would each be an incident

**Production schedules nothing.** `deploy/` holds one systemd unit and it is a plain
`Type=simple` web process — no timer, no `OnCalendar`. The only crons in the repository are
in `vercel.json`, and production is a VPS. SMS dispatch, partition maintenance and the alert
monitor are unscheduled on the host that serves traffic. The backup cron *is* installed on the
box and is likewise absent from the repo, which shows hand-installation is the undocumented
practice.

**Five of the seven alerts cannot fire on a total outage.** They are ratio conditions. A
deployment with zero sends, zero syncs, zero logins and a 4,000-device push fleet evaluates to
an empty alert list. `push_failure_rate` reads two columns no code ever writes. There is no
heartbeat, so a silent sink and a healthy deployment are indistinguishable.

**Three commercial controls report success on a school that does not exist.** `POST
/opsstate`, `/portal` and `/grace` returned 200 for tenant `1111…` — zero rows in
`tenants`, zero in `tenant_operations` — and wrote three audit entries for operations that
never occurred. The endpoints `UPDATE … WHERE tenant_id = $1` with no `rowCount` check.
Migration 053 fixed exactly this for `app.set_student_cap` with `IF NOT FOUND THEN RAISE
EXCEPTION`, and its own header describes the bug. One endpoint got the fix; these three did
not.

## What is genuinely strong, and should be said

The entitlement gate is real, database-enforced, fails closed, and was **observed refusing
live requests** on every surface probed. The Bangla refusal reason comes from
`app.tenant_access()` at the database layer, not from the UI. No entitlement anywhere is
frontend-only. Both platform credentials are independently required (key alone 401, JWT alone
403). The guardian phone is nulled server-side and was observed absent from live bodies for
three teacher roles. Backup and one restore drill carry genuine production evidence, and
`production-evidence.json` correctly refuses to let a rehearsal close a production gate.

## Corrections to earlier records

- **Double-period placement IS implemented** (F-504, `f820faf`). The final project audit said
  it was missing. That was wrong.
- **The overview is quadratic, not linear.** The prior 1.36 s @ 79 tenants does not reproduce
  (0.45 s @ 111 today), but `app.platform_overview()` seq-scans the whole `users` table once
  per tenant, and `app.tenant_access` costs 2.3× that scan. A ~380 ms JIT tax already fires
  at 5 tenants.
- **B-39 quantified:** `audit.platform_access` holds 1,959 rows across 6 distinct
  `admin_id`s; there is no operator table anywhere; `admin_id` has no foreign key and
  resolves to zero rows in `users`. Two operators produce md5-identical API responses.
- **Operator authorization is a claim check, not an account check.** A `super_admin` token
  for a `sub` and `tid` that exist nowhere returned 111 tenants. Not "anyone can forge a
  token" — the signing key is still required — but there is no account, so no individual
  operator can be disabled and revocation is all-or-nothing.

## Gate

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Areas audited | 22 of 22, plus a runtime entitlement matrix |
| Agents | 30 completed (16 re-run after a session limit; results replayed from cache) |
| Adversarial passes | 6 — four survey conclusions overturned |
| Verdict-changing claims re-verified by hand | 5 of 5 |
| Code changed | **none** — report only |
| `index.html` | `496199bd`, unchanged |

**Outcome:** NOT READY FOR PILOT, on five items (B-46…B-50 plus the SMS aggregator and the
049–064 catch-up). P9 not started, and blocked on four prerequisites of its own.

# P0 — core write paths + production operations   (2026-09-02) · **IN PROGRESS**

The four missing writers, the operational gaps, and the defects found
underneath them. Delivered as verified checkpoints rather than one commit.

## Checkpoint 1 — `dbd838e`

**The routine editor's query had never parsed.** `services/rms-svc/api/editor.ts`
selected `rm.name`; `rooms` has `code` and `name_bn` and no `name`. PostgreSQL
rejects that at parse time, so BOTH of the editor's slot queries failed on every
call — the grid has never rendered, and the Bangla clash sentence it builds has
never been shown to anyone. Now `COALESCE(rm.name_bn, rm.code)`, matching the
precedent at `ops-svc/api/document.ts:457`.

Nothing caught it because nothing ran it: the rms suites exercise the SOLVER,
and the editor sits downstream of a `routines` row that no code could create.
`sql-columns.test.ts` now resolves every SQL alias in the service against the
live schema. Its first draft scanned whole files and reported four false
positives that were TypeScript property accesses on a result row; it reads only
SQL template literals now.

**Three platform controls reported success on a school that does not exist.**
`/opsstate`, `/portal`, `/service` and `/grace` ran `UPDATE … WHERE tenant_id = $1`
with no rowCount check, wrote an audit row, and returned 200. `/status` was
better and still wrong: `set_tenant_status` raises P0002, only 02000 was mapped,
so it answered 500. Fixed the way migration 053 fixed `set_student_cap` —
`requireExistingTenant` before any mutation, so no phantom audit row is written,
plus a `rows.length` check in `afterChange()`, which every operations endpoint
returns through and a new endpoint cannot forget.

## Checkpoint 2 — `9af6a9d` · workstream A3 complete

**`rooms` had no writer and no write scope.** Read-only since migration 003 —
the solver, the routine grid, the admit card and the seat plan all read it, and
across 112 institutions there were **zero rows**. It was also writable by
anybody: a session holding `app.role = 'student'` inserted one, proved against a
live database, and proved refused after migration 065.

Nobody gets DELETE. `exam_halls.room_id` is ON DELETE RESTRICT while
`sections.home_room_id` and `routine_slots.room_id` are ON DELETE SET NULL, so a
delete either fails on a hall or makes every past routine forget where a class
was held. Capabilities are read from the database rather than a constant: the
valid set is whatever the school's own subjects actually require.

My own test caught a PATCH bug before it shipped — omitted fields fell through
to create-time defaults, so `{id, isBookable:false}` silently reset capacity to
60 and wiped the lab capabilities that decide which practicals can be placed.

## Checkpoint 3 — `7f9c7be` · workstream A1 complete

**Nothing could create an exam, and publishing had never executed.** Each
defect hid the other: with no exam to publish, `POST /academics/publish` was
unreachable and its SQL was never sent to a server. That SQL was

    UPDATE exam_marks m … FROM exam_subjects es,
      LATERAL app.compute_subject_grade(…, m.cq_marks, …)

which PostgreSQL rejects at parse time — an UPDATE's target is not in scope for
a LATERAL in its own FROM list. Rewritten as a CTE, with the same join
predicates, the same filter, the same arguments and the same `row_version + 1`.

Migration 066 gives both exam tables the write scope they never had; a subject
teacher's session could insert an exam before it. An exam is created WITH its
papers, maxima copied from `class_subjects` per migration 005's own
instruction — an exam with no papers is invisible, because the marks feed INNER
JOINs them, so a create that would produce none rolls back entirely.

**Found by using the screen rather than reading it:** creating a room
succeeded, said so, and the list underneath still showed the empty state.
`/api/v1/rms/` is cached stale-while-revalidate as reference data — right for a
published timetable, wrong for a register read before a write and re-read after
it. Now network-only for `rooms` and `exams`; the timetable stays cached. B-59.

**An unexplained flake, instrumented rather than dismissed:** an ops-svc suite
failed once in ten full runs, and the runner's 40-line tail had scrolled past
the cause. `test-all.mjs` now dumps full output to a file on any failure. B-58,
deliberately left OPEN — an intermittent failure that was never explained is
not a passing test.

## Gate at checkpoint 3

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Full suite | **1,644 passing**, 12 workspaces |
| SQL suites | **26/26**, on a database built only from migrations |
| Migrations | **66/66**, applied clean to a fresh database |
| TypeScript — all three CI configs | 0 errors, baseline 69 |
| Build | `app.js` + `sw.js` + 11 API bundles |
| Browser | room created, listed and deactivated through a confirm proved reachable by `elementFromPoint` |
| Both fixes proved load-bearing | reverting the CTE reproduces the parse error across 5 tests; dropping `exams_insert_scope` breaks the database-refusal test |
| `index.html` | `496199bd` |

# P0 checkpoint 4 — A2 fee structures

`577162e` server · `ccf7226` UI · `31d364d` the silent-refusal fix

## What A2 was

The third instance of one shape. `fee_structures` had no writer, so the
monthly invoice run joined an empty table and issued empty bills — exactly
as `rooms` fed an empty solver and `exams` fed a complete marks pipeline
nothing could start.

Migration 067 gave the three fee tables the per-command RESTRICTIVE write
scopes they never had: a PERMISSIVE `tenant_isolation` policy alone let any
role in the tenant insert a price. It also added
`uq_fee_structure_scope … NULLS NOT DISTINCT`, because `quota_category` is
always NULL and UNIQUE treats NULLs as distinct — the "already priced" guard
had silently never fired. Zero live violations were confirmed before adding
it.

The screen offers **no** `quota_category` field, because the invoice run
joins `fs.quota_category IS NULL`. A field the engine ignores would be a
price the office believes it set.

## Found by using it

**Both P0 writers refused saves in total silence.** A duplicate price is
refused with a 409 and a Bangla sentence. The drawer closed, the typed
values were discarded, the list re-read, and nothing was shown. Two
independent faults: `handle.close()` ran before the request was sent, and
`send()` set `this.error` whose own `finally` called `load()`, whose first
statement is `this.error = ''`. `rooms-view.ts` had both, in code already
committed at `9af6a9d` — every failed room save had been silent since.

**Neither view could be imported by a test at all.** Both used a
`private readonly o` parameter property, which Node's type-stripping runner
rejects outright. That is why neither had a view test. Now both use the
explicit assignment every other view uses, and
`apps/pwa/test/writer-save-errors.test.ts` covers them together — asserting
the *server's* message reaches the screen, since a generic failure line
would satisfy a weaker test and still leave a clerk unable to tell a
duplicate from a dead connection.

**`services/finance-svc` had test files and no `test` script.** The twelve
A2 tests had never once run under `npm test`; `scripts/test-all.mjs` reported
it as an error, which is the check working. Adding the package.json put them
in the suite.

**Two suites were being skipped for want of a credential, not a reason.**
`platform-svc` and 41 `server-core` tests need `PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL`.
Supplied, the suite went from 1,572 to 1,660.

## Gate at checkpoint 4

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Full suite | **1,660 passing**, 13 workspaces (`DATABASE_URL` + `PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL`) |
| SQL suites | **26/26** — run via `docker exec`, as `psql` is not on this machine's PATH |
| TypeScript — all three CI configs | 0 errors |
| Build | `app.js` + `sw.js` + 11 API bundles |
| Browser — create/edit/delete | done through the real UI, persisted across reload |
| Browser — duplicate refused | 409 shown in the drawer, typed values kept, no row written |
| Tenant isolation | proved against a **second real school**, not a missing one |
| Role model | student/guardian 403 on read; teacher 200 `canManage:false`; accountant 200 `canManage:true` |
| A3 room regression | Room A → visible → **survives reload** → Room B — passes |
| `index.html` | `496199bd` |

## Recorded honestly

**A1 is backend-complete, not product-complete.** `academics-svc/api/exams.ts`
has POST and PATCH and is routed. No screen calls it: the only PWA callers of
`/api/v1/academics/exams` are `marks-view` and `scripts-view`, both read-only
with `?sectionId=`, and `exam-routine-view` posts to `/api/v1/rms/examroutine`
— scheduling an exam that already exists, not creating one. **An admin still
cannot create an exam through the product.**

**B-58 remains OPEN.** Untouched by this checkpoint and still unexplained.

**B-60, new:** `db/tests/guardian_links.sql` is not idempotent — it commits
its fixture tenants and only rolls back its last block, so a second run fails
on `tenants_pkey`. Pre-existing, unrelated to 067; it passes once its own
leftovers are cleared. 26/26 was reached that way.

## Still to do in P0

A4 routine authoring · B production scheduling · C alerting and the deadman ·

# P0 checkpoint 5 — A1 exam management

`62b6146` the lifecycle fix and migration 068 · `660afed` the exam register UI

## What A1 was

The inverse of A2. A2 had a screen with no writer beneath it; A1 had a
complete writer — POST and PATCH since migration 066 — that no screen had ever
called. Marks, grades, GPA, rank, publish, the progress report and the admit
card were all built on something no school could create.

The screen asks for **sections**, not subjects: the server writes `exams` and
`exam_subjects` in one transaction, one paper per (section × subject the class
teaches), maxima copied from `class_subjects` and frozen. Two sections in a
real school produced 24 papers, and the exam then appeared in the marks-entry
picker with all twelve of its subjects — OBSERVED in a browser.

## The finding that mattered more than the screen

**Publishing an exam routine permanently bricked the exam.** Proved end to end
against the real HTTP API, in the order a school works:

| Step | Before 068 |
|---|---|
| create the exam | planned, 12 papers |
| publish the exam **routine** | `status` becomes `published` |
| correct a typo in the name | **409** already published |
| a teacher enters a mark | **conflict** `published_marks_immutable` |
| the office publishes the **results** | **409** already published |

`exams.status` is the RESULTS lifecycle — `published` means a parent has been
shown a grade, which is why `exams.ts`, `publish.ts` and
`sync-svc/appliers.ts` all treat it as final. `POST /rms/examroutine
{publish:true}` publishes the SCHEDULE, weeks before anyone sits a paper, and
wrote that same value. Nothing anywhere moves status backwards, so there was
no recovery inside the product.

The routine wrote `status` because both routine guards hang off it. They are
guards about the timetable — `assert_exam_halls_staffed` says so in its own
HINT — so **migration 068** moves them to `exams.routine_published_at` along
with the fact they were guarding, and repairs any row already wearing the
wrong status.

**Four tests asserted the conflation**, which is why a green suite never
noticed it: `examroutine.test.ts` asserted `exam.status === 'published'` after
a routine publish, `exam-routine-view.test.ts` built its fixture with
`status: 'published'`, and `db/tests/exam_clash.sql` and `seat_plan.sql`
published the same way. All four now assert that announcing a timetable does
**not** move `exams.status`, so the correction is itself a guard.

## What 066 had stopped short of

066 scoped writes on `exams` and `exam_subjects`, and left `exam_marks`
restricted on INSERT and SELECT only and `exam_results` on SELECT only.
Everything else fell through to the PERMISSIVE `tenant_isolation`, which asks
only "same school?". Proved live as `dept_head`, a role that cannot enter a
mark at all:

```
DELETE FROM exam_marks   -> 1 row, on an exam whose results were PUBLISHED
DELETE FROM exam_results -> 1 row
DELETE FROM exams        -> 0 rows   (066 holds — the control)
```

`trg_marks_immutable` does not save it: it is `BEFORE UPDATE OF` the four
component columns and never fires on DELETE. `subjects` and `academic_years`
had no DELETE policy either and both cascade into the exam tables — as
`subject_teacher`, `DELETE FROM exam_subjects` was refused and
`DELETE FROM subjects` took the paper and its marks anyway. All five closed;
the `principal` publish path re-verified working afterwards.

## Recorded honestly

**There is no role named `teacher`.** The codes are `subject_teacher`,
`class_teacher`, `dept_head`, `academic_coordinator`, … A probe that invents
one tests nothing; the first version of this phase's probe did exactly that
and its "refused" result was meaningless.

**A second instance of B-58's signature.** During the first full-suite run
`services/platform-svc/test/nonexistent-tenant.test.ts` failed as a
WHOLE FILE — `test at …:1:1`, `'test failed'`, empty stderr — the signature of
a hook throwing rather than an assertion failing, which is exactly what B-58
records for `ops-svc/branding.test.ts`. It did not reproduce: 6/6 in
isolation, 4/4 running that workspace as the runner does, and the next full
suite was 1,675/1,675. **B-58 stays OPEN**, now with two observed instances
rather than one. Recorded in BACKLOG as B-66.

**A1 is now end-to-end complete. A2 and A3 are unaffected** — both writers'
regression suites and the network-only cache rules were re-run green.

## Still to do in P0

A4 routine authoring · B production scheduling · C alerting and the deadman ·
D entitlement bypasses · E fresh-tenant E2E.

## Addendum to checkpoint 5 — a third instance of B-58's signature

The final gate run failed too, in a **third** file:
`services/ops-svc/test/events.test.ts`, whole-file, empty stderr, 362ms.

Four full-suite runs this phase: two green at 1,675, two failed — each in a
different file, neither reproducible. Six consecutive clean runs of `ops-svc`
alone and four of `platform-svc` alone.

Ruled out with evidence: connection exhaustion (`max_connections` 100, 6 in
use), cross-workspace parallelism (`test-all.mjs` is sequential `execSync`),
and `installTestKeys` (process-local `process.env`). The narrowed suspect is
`lockFixtures`' deliberately **unref'd** socket: if no ref'd handle remains at
some instant, Node exits the process mid-file, which is exactly a fast, silent,
whole-file failure. **Not proven, and B-58 stays OPEN** — see `B-66`.

Stated plainly: **the full suite is not reliably green on this machine.** Every
individual workspace is, and every A1 assertion in this phase was verified by
running its own suite directly. That is the honest state.

# P0 checkpoint 6 — A4 routine authoring

`c9bfa70` migration 069 · `2e90d1b` the server writer · `2109141` the UI

## What A4 was

The last missing writer, and the least missing of the four. The routine domain
is the richest in the product — five lifecycle states, three GiST exclusion
constraints, a period template per shift, parallel blocks, double periods, a
solver, a cross-shift guard — and **`routines` and `routine_slots` held 0 rows
in every tenant**, while 10 period templates and 100 period definitions sat
provisioned and unused.

`INSERT INTO routines` appeared nowhere outside test fixtures.
`api/solve.ts` says so in its own header: *"routine setup has no admin UI
yet"*. So the editor opened on a grid it could not fill, the solver filled a
routine that could not exist, and the publish button published it.

`editor.ts` gains **create-routine, place, assign, remove** beside the existing
move and publish. Nothing was rebuilt: the three exclusion constraints remain
the arbiter, `explainConflict` remains the sentence, and no second timetable
system was introduced.

## Three findings from writing the endpoint's first-ever test

**`explainConflict` had never once run.** It queries *after* the failed write
to find who owns the hour — but a failed statement aborts the transaction, so
that query died with 25P02 and the informative 409 became a 500. §8.1's whole
"never just 'invalid'" requirement was structurally unreachable, on the `move`
path that has existed since the routine editor shipped. Fixed with a savepoint,
the device `writeAudit` already uses for the same reason.

**The three constraints do not say the same thing.** Section is keyed on
`routine_id` and fires at every status; teacher and room are keyed on
`academic_year_id` and only `WHERE routine_status = 'active'`. A draft may
therefore hold one teacher in two places with no complaint until publish, when
`propagate_routine_status` flips every slot at once. Coherent, but a coordinator
would place forty lessons and be told at publish that the third was wrong — so
the two year-scoped dimensions are checked in the API at placement time. The
database is still the final gate.

**`explainConflict` filtered by `routine_id` for all three dimensions**, so a
teacher or room clash — which can live in a *different* routine — found nothing
and fell back to the generic sentence. Scoped per dimension now.

## What migration 069 closed

`routines` and `routine_slots` carried a RESTRICTIVE policy written
`FOR ALL … USING (true)`. That gates INSERT and an UPDATE's new row through the
WITH CHECK and gates DELETE not at all. Proved live as `student`:

```
INSERT routine_slots -> refused    (the WITH CHECK works)
DELETE routine_slots -> 1 row
DELETE routines      -> 1 row      (cascading to every slot)
```

`routine_substitutions` has the identical policy. `period_templates`,
`period_definitions` and `routine_slot_sections` had no write scope at all.

And on the same axis, `tenants` had one policy with no role predicate:

```
UPDATE tenants SET weekend_days = '{0,1,2,3,4,5,6}'         -> 1 row
UPDATE tenants SET plan_code='complete', student_cap=999999 -> 1 row
```

The second is a **self-serve upgrade to every paid service** — `app.tenant_access()`
reads `plan_code`, so the whole D16 commercial layer was bypassable by any
account in a school. Closed by a trigger, because RLS cannot say "these columns,
not those". The A2 fee fixture was buying its plan that way and now buys it at
creation.

## The hard-coded school week

`routine-editor-view.ts` drew five fixed columns from a constant. The teaching
week is `tenants.weekend_days`, and the live data already varies: **137 tenants
on `{5,6}`, one on `{5}`** — for that school Saturday is a teaching day the grid
had no column for. Days now come from the server.

## Recorded honestly

**A suspicion I raised and then disproved.** Switching tenants by hand showed
the previous school's sections, which looked like a cache-privacy leak. It is
not: `doLogout()` calls `purgeLocalData('logout')`, which deletes the service
worker's caches (`local-data.ts:149`). B-8's fix is real; the effect was an
artifact of editing `localStorage` instead of logging out, which no user can do.

**`section_subject_teachers` is empty across the whole CI database.** Not a gap
— assignment has a writer (`app.assign_subject_teacher`, `POST /ops/assign`)
and a UI (`academic-view`). It is unseeded fixture data, and A4's teacher picker
depends on a school having done that step first.

**The routine domain is not an entitleable service.** The catalogue has no
`routine` or `timetable` entry, so rms handlers omitting `service:` is an
absence, not the B-70(b) bypass. Adding one is a commercial decision.

# P-writers complete — B-48 payment and receipt (2026-09-03)

`ddbab64` migration 070 and the webhook fix · `cb34338` the writer and its UI ·
`ea01193` a fixture that asked the wrong day

## The last missing writer

`fee_structures` priced the bill (A2), `generate` issued it — and nothing could
record that it had been paid. The only `INSERT INTO payment_receipts` in the
product was inside the MFS webhook, and `POST /finance/pay` returns 503 until
merchant credentials exist. So the ledger, the receipts screen, a student's
payment history and `mv_fee_collection` all read a table only an unreachable
webhook could fill.

`POST /api/v1/finance/payments` applies the payment, issues the receipt and
posts the balanced ledger pair in one transaction. It is **not** the online
flow: `/finance/pay` stays kill-switched, because a gateway payment needs
credentials this deployment does not have and faking one would be worse than
refusing it. What an office does is take money by hand, and
`payment_receipts.method` has modelled `cash`, `cheque` and `bank_transfer`
since migration 007.

**Partial payments are the normal case.** There is no uniqueness on
`invoice_id` and `app.apply_payment_to_invoice` sets `partly_paid` when the
running total is short, so a family paying in instalments gets a receipt each
time. The endpoint takes an amount and refuses only an overpayment —
`invoices.balance_amount` is `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (total_amount - paid_amount)`
and would otherwise store a negative silently.

## Two money defects, both proved before they were fixed

**A student could forge a receipt.** `invoices` was scoped properly; the tables
either side of it were on `tenant_isolation` alone. As `app.role='student'`:

```
UPDATE payment_receipts SET amount = 1          -> 1 row
DELETE FROM payment_receipts                    -> 1 row
INSERT INTO payment_receipts (… 99999, 'cash')  -> allowed
UPDATE invoice_lines SET amount = 0             -> 2 rows
UPDATE invoices SET status='paid'               -> 0 rows   (the control)
```

SELECT was scoped too — every student could read every family's payment
history. DELETE is granted to the three money roles rather than refused: a
receipt has no void column, so a hard block would make a mis-keyed one
permanently uncorrectable, and the FK is already `ON DELETE RESTRICT`.

**A receipt could silently never be issued.** The webhook built its number as
`max()+1` inline and wrote it `ON CONFLICT … DO NOTHING RETURNING receipt_no`,
reading the result through optional chaining. Its own comment claimed that
generating the number in SQL stopped concurrent webhooks colliding; it does
not. Two transactions read the same maximum, one inserted, the other got zero
rows — and `app.apply_payment_to_invoice` had **already run**. Money applied,
invoice paid, ledger posted, no receipt, no error. `app.next_receipt_no()` now
allocates under an advisory lock and the `ON CONFLICT` is gone.

## Recorded honestly

**A fixture asked the wrong day.** `ward.test.ts` failed with `todayStatus`
`absent`. Not my change and not the month-boundary bug its own comment
describes: the fixture used `CURRENT_DATE` while the endpoint reads
`app.today_dhaka()` (migration 059). Caught at 20:39 UTC on the 2nd — 02:39 on
the 3rd in Dhaka. **The suite failed every evening UTC and passed every
morning.** Fixed in the fixture, which now asks the question the product
answers.

**A suspicion raised and disproved.** Hand-editing `localStorage` to switch
tenants showed the previous school's data, which looked like a cache-privacy
leak. It is not: `doLogout()` calls `purgeLocalData('logout')`, which deletes
the service worker caches. B-8's fix is real; no user can reach that state.

## P-writers is complete

`B-46` exam creation · `B-47` fee amounts · `B-48` payment/receipt ·
`B-49` routine/room creation — all four closed, each with a UI and browser

# P-ops — C: entitlements that were never enforced (2026-09-03)

P-ops A and B (`54610ce`) gave production a schedule and a heartbeat. C is
§5 of the brief: **the entitlement bypass audit**. Its rule was one sentence —
*the control MUST hold server-side; do not rely on hidden UI* — and the
starting point was `B-53`, an owner-audit row that named three endpoints.

## What was reproduced before anything was written

A school on the `starter` plan. Not "finance switched off" — **`not_in_plan`**,
a plan with no finance key at all, a school that never bought the module:

```
finance state = not_in_plan
gated   /finance/invoices            -> 403 ফি ও হিসাব এই প্রতিষ্ঠানের জন্য …
sibling /academics/students/history  -> 200
  >>> fees : {"years":[{"invoices":1,"billed":"1300.00","paid":"1300.00", …
sibling /ops/dashboard               -> 200
  >>> finance: {"invoiced":"1300.00","collected":"1300.00","outstanding":"0.00"}
```

The commercial gate and the privacy gate were the same gate, and both were
bypassed by asking a different URL.

## The shape, and why the obvious fix was the wrong one

An endpoint declares `service:` in its `TenantContext` and `tenant_guard`
refuses the request. Six endpoints declared nothing — correctly, because each
is a *composite*: a student's history is enrolments **and** attendance **and**
results **and** fees, four separate purchases on one page.

Gating those endpoints as a whole would have been the wrong fix. A school that
never bought finance still legitimately wants a child's attendance record, and
a 403 for the page takes away something they do have. So **each block is gated
on its own service**, and an off service yields `null` — the same shape an
unauthorised role already produced, which every caller already handled.

`limited` still serves throughout: it is the billing-arrears state, and which
services survive it is `service_catalogue.in_limited`'s decision, not a
handler's. Two tests were rewritten mid-flight when they asserted my opinion
against that table — the catalogue says finance does *not* survive arrears and
documents do not either, and pinning the endpoint to the policy is worth more
than pinning it to what I assumed the policy should be.

## Six sites

| Endpoint | Was leaking | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `academics/studenthistory` | attendance, results, fees | per-block, `services:{}` says which |
| `academics/ward` | the guardian's own three cards | per-block; no card for a module the school lacks |
| `academics/hierarchy` | the 90-day attendance summary | `null`, not a zeroed object |
| `ops/dashboard` | the finance tile, gated on ROLE alone | role **and** entitlement; `financeAvailable` says why |
| `ops/document` | printable receipts, report cards, admit cards, attendance sheets | `CONTENT_SERVICE` per document type |
| `rms/examroutine` | the whole exam timetable | declares `service: 'results'`, like `academics/exams` |

**`ops/document` was the worst of them.** These are not API responses; they are
branded, letterheaded pages a school hands to a parent or files with a board.
A fee receipt printed by a school with no finance module is paper nobody in
that office can reconcile against anything. It refuses with 403 rather than an
empty page: a blank sheet reads as *this child has no record*, a different and
more alarming claim than *this school does not run that module*.

`id_card` and `transfer_certificate` map to no content service and still
print — the counter-assertion, and the one that would catch an over-correction.
A school closing its finance module has not stopped having students, and still
needs to send a child elsewhere.

## The push half, which the row named and nobody had closed

> *"Disabling `push` does not stop push at all — only the subscribe endpoint
> is gated, not the sending path."*

Exactly right, and the cause was worse than the row knew.
`SmsDispatchWorker.run` opened its transaction with `service: 'sms'`, and the
push stage runs *inside* that transaction. Two consequences, opposite in
direction:

1. **Push off did not stop push.** A device registered before the switch kept
   receiving notifications. With `pushReplacesSms` on, an accepted push
   *cancels* the queued SMS — so a school that disabled push and left that
   setting on had its paid fallback cancelled by a transport it had switched
   off. The guardian got neither. Silence in both channels.

2. **`B-83`: no school on the `pilot` plan has ever received a push.**
   `pilot` and `madrasa_basic` carry `push: true` and no `sms` key at all, so
   `sms = not_in_plan`, the gate refused the run before its first statement,
   and the push stage never executed. Verified across four live pilot tenants,
   every one reporting `push_state = enabled`. Their subscribe endpoint
   answered 200 and their devices registered. `pilot` is the plan real pilot
   schools are on.

The original comment justified the `sms` gate by cost — *"every message here
costs the school money"* — and that reasoning is right about SMS and was never
right about push, which is free. The run is now gated on tenant **access**
only, so a suspended school still sends nothing, and each transport is gated
on its own service inside.

`B-85` is the honest limit and is recorded rather than half-built: enqueueing
is the billable act, so a push-only school now pushes correctly and pushes
*nothing*, because push is a cheaper transport for SMS traffic and not yet an
independent channel. Giving it its own queue is design work, not a bug fix.

## Two bugs the audit was not looking for

**`B-82` — the class-performance screen had never rendered.** `classperf.ts`
selected `s.name_bn` from `sections`, whose column is `name`; `subjects` is
the table with `name_bn` and is aliased `sub` two lines away. SQLSTATE 42703
at parse time — unconditional, needing no data. Every request that endpoint
ever received was a 500.

It was found because of **`B-86`**: `studenthistory`'s `catch` discarded the
error entirely, and adding a `console.error` to it (the response left
deliberately opaque — that endpoint returns a child's record and a leaked SQL
message names columns) paid for itself within the hour by printing the cause
of a *different* endpoint's failure.

## Browser acceptance

Guardian session, real API, `starter` school. The guardian home renders the
identity, the attendance card and the result card, **no fees card and no pay
button** — screenshot in the session. It crashed on the first attempt with
`Cannot read properties of null (reading 'outstanding')`, which is the browser
confirming the API change was real and that three view consumers had to move
with it: `guardian-view` (cards and CTA), `academic-view` (three states for
the 90-day card, not two), and `payCta`, which I had missed. `principal-home-view`
already handled `finance: null` correctly and needed nothing.

Tapping "বেতন" refuses cleanly and leaks nothing — but says *"বেতন ও ফি দেখার
অনুমতি আপনার নেই। প্রয়োজন হলে প্রধান শিক্ষকের সাথে যোগাযোগ করুন"*, which is a
permission sentence for what is an entitlement fact. `HttpError`'s own comment
had already drawn that distinction — *"the screen has to say which"* — and the
screen was not saying which. `serverMessage` now keeps the server's Bangla
sentence for `tenant_blocked` and `service_unavailable`. The screens refusing
through `refuseUnlessOk` still cannot, because `HttpStatus(status)` discards
the body before any view sees it; that is **`B-84`**, left open with its reason
rather than threaded through every denied state inside this phase.

## Recorded honestly

**A pre-existing suite was passing for the wrong reason.** `ward.test.ts`
seeded its school without a `plan_code`, taking the `starter` default — a plan
with no finance. Its three fee assertions were exercising a path that school
could never legitimately reach, and only passed because the entitlement was
never checked. The fixture now says `complete`.

**Two of my own tests asserted an opinion, not the policy.** Both claimed a
school in arrears should keep something `service_catalogue.in_limited` says it
loses. Rewritten to pin the catalogue's decision, with the note that changing
it is a row in that table and not an `if` in a handler.

**An invalid curve point looked exactly like a working gate.** The push
fixture's `p256dh` was base64 of the right length and not a P-256 point, so
encryption failed inside `web-push`, the spy transport was never contacted,
and three tests "passed". The baseline assertion — *with push ON, the device
IS contacted* — is what caught it, and is why it is there.

**A failing test poisoned the ones after it.** A test that asserts and then
restores never restores when it fails, so the next run saw a school still in
`limited` and reported a second, unrelated failure. State is reset in
`beforeEach` now.

## Evidence

- 1744 tests across 13 workspaces, all passing. 24 new, in three suites.
- Every new suite proven **red first** against the un-fixed code: academics
  4/11 red, ops 4/7 red, sms 5/6 red, and the original seven 5/7 red.
- `tsc --noEmit` clean at every step.
- Live reproduction and live re-verification of all six endpoints on a running
  stack, before and after, plus four pilot tenants inspected for `B-83`.
- `db/tests (sql)` **did not run** — `psql` is not on PATH in this
  environment. 26 files, unexecuted, and not counted as passing.

# P-ops — D and E: the deadman, the guard, the matrix, and a school built from nothing (2026-09-06)

A and B gave production a schedule and a heartbeat. C closed the entitlement
leaks. D and E are the sections that ask whether any of it actually holds.

## The SQL suites, which had not run (`B-88`)

Before anything else, because it changed what everything else was standing on.

`test-all.mjs` reported `db/tests (sql) 0 of 26 — NOTHING RAN (psql is not on
PATH)`. Honest, and useless: those 26 files are the only tests that exercise
RLS, the RESTRICTIVE write scopes, the GiST EXCLUDE constraints and the
SECURITY DEFINER functions as PostgreSQL actually enforces them. A Node test
can only check what a handler did with the rows it was given.

The database this project develops against is a Docker container **that has
psql inside it**. The client was never missing; only the PATH was.
`scripts/sql-tests.mjs` pipes each file into the container's own psql, with
`ON_ERROR_STOP` kept and a refusal for any file using `\i` or `\copy` (whose
paths cannot resolve from inside the container). `test-all.mjs` falls back to
it only when there is no local psql, so CI keeps the direct path it already
uses.

**The very first run failed.** `schema_lint.sql` had been red since P-ops A,
because `ops_job_runs` — my own table, from migration 071, two commits earlier
— was not in its exempt list. Nothing had said so for two commits. The lint's
own comment records the identical thing happening to `plans` and
`service_catalogue` in P7: *"The lint caught both the day P7 shipped and was
not run until P8, which is the argument for running it."*

**26/26 now execute. 52/52 across two consecutive runs.**

## §3 — the deadman, through the database rather than around it

`alerts.test.ts` pinned `evaluateAlerts` as a pure function, which is right
for the rules and proves nothing about the loop they sit in. Between a rule
and an operator there are three more links — `record_job_run` writing,
`job_run_status()` reading, `gatherSignals` shaping — and a break in any of
them produces the exact failure the section exists to prevent: a deployment
that is not running and an alert list that is empty.

`packages/server-core/test/deadman.test.ts` writes real rows as the real jobs
do and asserts on what comes out the far end. Never-run fires. A stale
heartbeat is caught against each job's **own** interval — one global threshold
would either page on a healthy daily dispatcher or miss a dead 15-minute
monitor for a day. A failing job names its recorded error. **Recovery clears
it**, which is the half that decides whether anyone trusts the alert: one that
never clears is one people learn to ignore, and then the real one is ignored
too. `shikhon_app` cannot forge a heartbeat.

### Business silence is not job silence

The distinction the whole section turns on, and the one that made five of
seven alerts unable to fire on a total outage (`B-51`).

**Business silence** — no SMS sent, no register taken, nobody logged in.
Legitimate: a holiday, a small school, a quiet week. The correct number of
alerts is zero, and every ratio-shaped condition correctly says nothing.

**Job silence** — the dispatcher did not run. Not legitimate, and *invisible
to any ratio*, because the producer of the rows a ratio would read is the very
thing that stopped. `sms_queue_stalled` needs `smsQueuedNow > 0`, and the only
writer of those rows is the dead worker.

So job silence is measured against the **clock** and each job's own schedule,
never against volume. Two tests state it directly: an idle deployment with
dead crons fires three criticals; the same idle deployment with its schedules
alive is silent.

### The limit, asserted rather than hidden

The monitor cannot report its own death. `job_silent` for the monitor is only
ever *evaluated by* the monitor, so if the monitor is what stopped, nothing
computes the alert that would name it. What the heartbeat does buy is that the
gap is recorded and fires on its first run back — an outage is never silently
swallowed after the fact. Catching it *during* needs a check outside the box.
There is a test whose only job is to keep that sentence true.

## §4 — the row-count guard, generalised past the row that named it

`B-52` named `/opsstate`, `/portal`, `/service`, `/grace` and `/status`. Five
were fixed. The generalisation — "every POST that takes a `tenantId`", derived
from the dispatcher's own case list rather than from memory — found **three
more**:

| endpoint | answered, for a uuid that is not a school |
|---|---|
| `/branding` | **200**, echoing the colour back, plus an audit row |
| `/admin` | **500** `platform_error` |
| `/payment` | **500** `platform_error` |

`/payment` is the one with money on it: an operator recording a school's bank
transfer against a mistyped id got "the platform is broken" instead of "that
school is not here", and went to find an engineer while the payment sat
unentered.

The 500s deserve their own note, because `nonexistent-tenant.test.ts` already
had the sentence in its header for `/status`: *"we are broken" where the truth
is "that school is not here"*. A 404 makes an operator check what they pasted;
a 500 makes them escalate.

§4's third case — cross-tenant — now keeps a **bystander school** and asserts
that no mutation aimed at one changes another, or writes into its trail. For a
tenant-facing endpoint RLS makes that structural; the platform console is the
one surface deliberately allowed across schools, so nothing but a test can
know.

## §D — the whole matrix, derived rather than restated

C fixed six composite endpoints one at a time. Six files each asserting its
own corner cannot answer "is there a state, on any surface, that still serves
what it should not?"

`entitlement-matrix.test.ts` walks `{active, limited, maintenance, suspended}`
× seven surfaces, plus the per-service switch on top of `active` — which is
the `B-53` case and is *not* an ops_state at all. Every expectation is read
from `service_catalogue` and `app.tenant_service_state` **at run time**, so a
deliberate policy change moves the tests with it and an accidental one fails
them. Hard-coding the matrix would only be the policy written twice.

Two structural assertions beyond the cells: a 5xx is never a correct answer to
"may this school see this", and a suspended school is refused **before** the
service is consulted.

## §E — a school built from nothing, 24 steps

Every other suite starts from a fixture built by direct INSERT. That is cheap
and it is why nobody ever walks the road a real school walks — and the gaps in
that road are exactly the ones this project keeps finding late.

`fresh-tenant-e2e.test.ts` creates a school through the console and then drives
the product's own endpoints, in the order an office would, with **no direct
INSERT in the happy path**:

> create → operations row → provision → plan → branding → principal → it admin
> → activation + login → dashboard → structure → teacher → room → notice →
> calendar → academic year → sections → fee heads seeded → fee structure →
> student import preview → students imported → roster → guardian linked →
> routine created → exam

It found `B-87` on its first attempt: **a school could not add its first
teacher.** `staff_profiles.employee_code` is NOT NULL, the handler passed
`|| null` into it, and the form marked the field *optional* — so a principal
who left the staff-ID box empty got `internal_error`. Not an edge case: it is
the default path for any school that does not number its staff, and adding
staff is among the first things a new school does. Every unit test supplied the
field, so nothing had ever seen it.

It also **corrected `B-81`**, which claimed the chart of accounts is never
seeded. `app.provision_tenant` inlines it — 15 `ledger_accounts` at migration
012 §8, and the fee heads at §7. The real gap is narrower and is recorded as
such: a school created and never provisioned has neither, and no endpoint
writes those tables.

### What still needs manual SQL

Two things, and the test asserts the list so it can only change deliberately:

1. **Renaming a school**, or fixing its slug, EIIN, district or address
   (`B-55`). A school registered with a typo needs psql.
2. **Giving an UNPROVISIONED school its chart of accounts and fee heads**
   (`B-81`, revised).

Attendance is deliberately absent and is **not** a gap: `/academics/attendance`
is GET-only because a register is written through the offline sync queue — a
teacher marks it on a phone in a room with no signal. Walking it here would
test the queue rather than the road, and `packages/offline` and `sync-svc` own
that.

## §9 — suspension, and the state that had quietly become suspension

Suspension needs no revocation sweep, and finding that out is worth more than
building one: every request opens through `withTenant`, which asks
`app.tenant_access` on the connection it already holds. A suspended school
stops being honoured on the *next request*, which is stronger than a
revocation list that can go stale. Verified against a token minted before the
switch was thrown.

`B-54`'s second sentence turned out to be real and serious. A school in
`limited` — billing arrears — could read but **could not refresh**, because
rotating a refresh token is a write inside `transaction_read_only = on`. Every
user was signed out within one access-token lifetime and could not get back
in. Read-only had become suspension by accident, which makes the softer state
useless: its entire purpose is that a school behind on fees can still read its
own records.

`withTenant` gained `sessionWrite`, placed deliberately **below** the
`access = 'none'` check so a suspended school still cannot renew. A
`user_sessions` row is not the school's business data; it is the platform's
record of who is signed in, and withholding it protects no fee.

## §4 (UI) — four refusals, four sentences (`B-84`)

`HttpError`'s own comment had already drawn the line: *"a refused ROLE needs a
different person, a blocked TENANT needs a payment or a call to us — and the
screen has to say which."* The screen was not saying which.

Server: on a gate refusal that named a service, `app.tenant_service_state`
rides along as `serviceState`, so **not purchased** is machine-distinguishable
from **switched off** — different errands for the office. One extra query, on
the refusal path only.

Client: `refuseUnlessOk` became async and reads the server's code and Bangla
sentence into `HttpStatus`; `deniedMessage` and `deniedContact` choose the
wording *and whether to offer a colleague at all*. An arrears block has nobody
to ask, and offering one wastes a trip.

Browser-verified on a `starter` school: the fees screen now reads
*"ফি ও হিসাব এই প্রতিষ্ঠানের প্ল্যানে নেই। প্ল্যান পরিবর্তনের জন্য shikhonBD-এর
সঙ্গে যোগাযোগ করুন।"* — with no head-teacher line.

## §12 — B-80 and B-81, classified rather than absorbed

Neither is taken into P-ops, and the reasons are stated so the decision can be
argued with rather than merely trusted.

**`B-80`** is a finance phase. `invoices.late_fee` is read and never written,
so the column is always 0 — the invoice is internally consistent and simply
under-bills; a **missing feature**, not a broken one. `invoice_no` from
`count(*)` looks like `B-78`, but `invoices` carries
`UNIQUE (tenant_id, invoice_no)`, so a reused number **raises 23505** rather
than producing two invoices sharing a number. No book is ever wrong. It does
not block a real institution's finance lifecycle — billing, collection,
receipts and ledger posting all work — it blocks *late-fee* billing only, and
it waits on a product decision about when a late fee accrues.

**`B-81`** is corrected above and reduced to the unprovisioned-tenant case.

## Recorded honestly

**I was running the wrong typecheck.** `tsc -p tsconfig.json` **excludes
`apps/pwa`**, so three views used `deniedMessage` without importing it and
passed my check; the esbuild bundle caught it. The repository has
`scripts/typecheck.mjs`, which runs all three CI configs and compares its
scope against `.github/workflows/security.yml`. That is the gate; the bare
`tsc` I had been using is not.

**Two of my own tests asserted an opinion again.** The arrears case for push,
and the console-reachability check. Both rewritten to pin
`service_catalogue.in_limited` and the real function signature.

**A failing test poisoned the ones after it, twice.** A test that asserts and
then restores never restores when it fails. State is reset in `beforeEach` in
both suites now.

**A guarded `if` nearly hid a step.** The E2E's guardian link was wrapped in
`if (students.length > 0)`, so an import that committed nothing would have
produced a silently shorter walk. It asserts instead — and immediately showed
that the roster returns `roster`/`studentId`, not `students`/`id`.

## Evidence

- **1775 tests across 13 workspaces, all passing**, plus **26/26 SQL suites
  executed** (52/52 over two runs).
- 40 new tests this segment: deadman 9, row-count guard 8 (2 new), matrix 7,
  suspension 6, fresh-tenant 2, B-84 6.
- `node scripts/typecheck.mjs` — three CI configs, 0 errors, coverage
  267/338 with the unchecked baseline unmoved at 71.
- `node scripts/build.mjs` — clean.
- Browser acceptance for `B-84` on a live stack, screenshot in session.
- Landing page byte-identical: `apps/pwa/public/index.html` @ `496199bd`.

## Still BLOCKED, and not counted as anything else

**The human alert (§2).** The delivery path is proven — the monitor built
three real alerts from real signals, `alertText` rendered a readable message,
and the transport returned `delivered: true`. It went to a stubbed `fetch`.
A configured URL, a fake webhook, a local sink and a POST without a human
receipt are all **not** a pass, and this is a rehearsal. It needs a real
`ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` and a person confirming the message arrived.

**REHEARSED. Not OBSERVED IN PRODUCTION. Not PASS.**

# P-ops — closure patch: B-87 fixed, B-55 classified (2026-09-06)

Two loose ends from D and E, closed rather than carried.

## B-87 — the staff ID, and the second 500 behind it

The §E walk could not add a teacher. `staff_profiles.employee_code` is NOT
NULL **and** `UNIQUE (tenant_id, employee_code)`; the handler passed
`|| null` into it and the form marked the box optional, so an empty staff ID
produced `internal_error`.

### The decision, which the product had already made twice

Required, not generated, and the two sibling contracts say why they differ:

| column | how it is set | why |
|---|---|---|
| `student_profiles.student_code` | **generated** — `studentCodeFor(userId)`, `STU-` + 8 hex of the uuid | a child does not arrive holding a student number; deriving it from the id cannot collide |
| `staff_profiles.employee_code` | **supplied** — `teacher-import.ts` refuses a CSV with no `employee_code` column (L121) and fails a blank cell (L159), de-duplicating within the file | it is the school's own staff number, already on their paperwork |

Generating one in the form would give the same teacher one code when typed and
a different one when imported from the school's own spreadsheet, and the app
would disagree with the office's records. So the form was brought in line with
the importer, not the other way round.

"Safely optional" was considered and rejected: it means dropping a NOT NULL
that has stood since migration 002 and that the CSV path actively enforces —
the largest change of the three, and one that weakens a constraint to avoid
writing an error message.

### The second 500, which is the likelier one

`ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO NOTHING` covers the primary key and **not** the
`(tenant_id, employee_code)` unique. A school re-adding a teacher, or typing a
number already in use, raised 23505 and came back as a 500 — a far more
ordinary mistake than a blank box, and one an office cannot act on. Now a 409
naming the field. The handler runs in one transaction, so a refused duplicate
leaves no `users` row behind holding a login and a role with no staff record.

The dead `isStaffRole` branch went with it: `GRANTABLE` contains no student or
guardian, so the condition implied a path that cannot exist.

**Browser-verified** on a live stack: created রফিক স্যার with `EMP-777`, then
submitted a second person with the same ID and read *"এই কর্মচারী আইডি
(EMP-777) আগেই ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে"* with the form still open on the wrong
value. Test data removed from the demo tenant afterwards.

## B-55 — classified, and it is two things

**(B) intentional platform-only — `slug`.** Migration 069's trigger refuses it
from `shikhon_app` by name, with its reason written down: *"plan, cap,
lifecycle, slug, weekend, shifts and key material are set by the platform, not
by a school account."* A slug lives in the install link and the PWA
`start_url`; changing it after launch moves every device's entry point. Not a
gap and needs no screen.

**(A) required platform-admin UI — `name_bn`, `name_en`, `eiin`, `district`,
`upazila`, `address_bn`.** No lock exists on these. They are absent from the
069 trigger's list and simply have no writer anywhere. They are routine
operator corrections — a typo at registration, an EIIN issued later, a
district fixed — and at a hundred schools that is a weekly errand.

**What sharpened the classification.** The school's own branding screen writes
a DISPLAY name into `settings->branding`, so a school's documents and app shell
can carry the corrected name while `app.platform_overview()` and the operator
console still show the typo. The gap looks closed from inside the school and is
not, which is worse than an obvious hole — and it is exactly why this needed
classifying rather than leaving as "SQL-only".

**Not built here.** P-ops is operational hardening; a new console screen is
feature work. Recorded per D13 as *"no writer — UI and endpoint both pending"*,
never as complete, and written into the runbook so the SQL-only behaviour is
disclosed rather than discovered.

## Verification, re-run from scratch after the fix

- **1781 tests across 13 workspaces, all passing** (5 new for B-87)
- **26/26 SQL suites executed; 52/52 over two consecutive runs**
- `scripts/typecheck.mjs` — three CI configs, **0/0/0**, coverage 268/339,
  unchecked baseline unmoved at 71
- `scripts/build.mjs` — clean
- `scripts/security-probe.mjs` — **29 checks, 29 pass, 0 fail** over 12 areas
- **D11** both directions: no platform brand in tenant surfaces; `index.html`
  (12) and `platform.ts` (5) keep theirs
- **D13**: B-87 verified by a person using the screen; B-55 reported as
  UI-pending rather than complete
- entitlement matrix 7 · surfaces 7 · blocks 11 · suspension 6 · push-only 7 ·
  row-count guard 8 · deadman 9 · tenant isolation 11 · staff create 5
- **§E re-run from scratch: 24 steps, 2/2**
- `apps/pwa/public/index.html` byte-identical at `496199bd`

## The two external blockers, unchanged and not upgraded

**Human alert receipt — BLOCKED.** The path is proven end to end and delivered
to a stubbed `fetch`. A configured transport is not a human receipt.

**VPS timer installation — NOT OBSERVED.** The units and the verification
commands exist in `deploy/shikhon-cron.md`; nothing here has run on the
production host. Until they are installed the heartbeat correctly reports
`job_never_ran`, which is the honest answer rather than a failure.

# P9-0 — Routine inventory, before any code (2026-09-06)

The brief says "do not rebuild existing solver functionality unnecessarily",
and that turns out to be the most important sentence in it. **The solver is
built.** What is missing is everything that would let a school feed it.

## READY — built, reachable, and exercised by tests

| piece | where | what it already does |
|---|---|---|
| Routine schema | migration 006 + 032 + 069 | `routines` (version, `supersedes_id`, `status`, solver provenance: `solver_run_id`, `solver_seconds`, `objective_score`, `soft_violations`, `constraint_weights`), `routine_slots` (day/period, real `time_range`, `slot_kind`, section/subject/teacher/room, `is_double` + `double_group_id`, `is_pinned`, `parallel_pool`) |
| **Hard clash prevention** | 3 GiST `EXCLUDE` constraints | teacher, room and section double-booking, enforced by PostgreSQL. A hard violation is **unstorable**, not merely detected |
| Solver | `rms-svc/src/solve.ts`, 1046 lines | greedy deterministic pass, **idempotent** (tops up `periodsPerWeek − alreadyPlaced`, so re-running fills gaps rather than duplicating), **cross-shift aware** (books teacher and room against the whole academic year and compares *time intervals*, not period numbers — F-506), **room capability matching** (F-504), **double periods** |
| Soft constraints | `rms-svc/src/soft-constraints.ts`, 311 lines | `teacher_weekly_cap`, `teacher_daily_cap`, `subject_consecutive_days`, `subject_twice_in_one_day`, `teacher_room_churn`, `teacher_no_free_day` |
| Solve endpoint | `POST /rms/solve` | runs the solver against an existing draft, writes slots + provenance |
| Explainability | `GET /rms/generation`, 314 lines + `generation-view.ts`, 460 lines | §8.2's two counters, per-slot "why this teacher, this room", soft trades listed. **Already refuses to narrate an unverified claim** — "একমাত্র যোগ্য ও মুক্ত শিক্ষক" is checked against the competency register and the rest of the timetable before it is said |
| Editor | `rms-svc/api/editor.ts`, 1043 lines (A4) | `create-routine`, `place`, `assign`, `move`, `remove`, `publish`, with conflict detection and 409s |
| Editor UI | `routine-editor-view.ts` | the week grid, drawers, teaching days from `tenants.weekend_days` |
| Rooms | `rms-svc/api/rooms.ts` (A4/B-49) | capacity, type, capability — a real writer |
| Substitutions | `rms-svc/api/substitute.ts` | day-to-day cover |
| Student/teacher view | `routine.ts` + `routine-view.ts` | "আজকের রুটিন" |

## The finding: 11 solver inputs, and how many a school can actually set

`solve.ts` reads eleven tables. This is what a school can do about each:

| input | rows on this box | writer | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sections`, `classes` | many | `ops-svc/api/structure.ts` | **READY** |
| `rooms` | 5 | `rms-svc/api/rooms.ts` | **READY** |
| `staff_profiles` (load caps) | many | `ops-svc/api/users.ts`, import | **READY** — but `max_periods_per_day/week` are not on any form |
| `subjects` | many | seeded from `subject_catalogue` by `provision_tenant` | **PARTIAL** — cannot be edited |
| `class_subjects` (**periods per week**, double periods) | 375, values 2–6 | seeded by `provision_tenant` | **PARTIAL** — *the single most important solver input, and no school can change it* |
| `period_templates` / `period_definitions` (bell times, breaks) | 11 / 105 | seeded by `provision_tenant` | **PARTIAL** — a school whose day differs from the default cannot say so |
| `tenants.weekend_days` | 183 (defaulted) | **none** — and migration 069 makes it *platform-owned*, refused to school accounts | **MISSING for the school** |
| `tenants.shifts` | — | **none**, also platform-owned | **MISSING for the school** |
| `section_subject_teachers` | **6 rows across 183 tenants** | **none** | **MISSING** — who teaches what, where |
| `teacher_competencies` | **0** | **none** | **MISSING** |
| `teacher_availability` | **0** | **none** | **MISSING** — blocked/preferred slots (B-45) |
| `teacher_leaves` | — | **none** | **MISSING** (B-45) |

`routines` = 1 and `routine_slots` = 2 on this box, both from A4's own test.

## What that means

The solver cannot produce a useful routine today, and not because of the
solver. Its two central teacher inputs — *who teaches what* and *when they
are free* — are empty tables with no writer, so a generation run would place
nothing and correctly report everything unplaced.

And **there is no generate button anywhere.** `POST /rms/solve` has no UI; its
own header has been saying so since it was written: *"Creating the draft
routine row itself (period template, academic year, shift setup) has no admin
UI yet."* `generation-view.ts` is routed `hidden: true` and reachable only
with a `?routineId=` that nothing hands out.

This is the same shape as `B-46`/`B-47`/`B-49` and the whole of P-writers: a
capability that exists, is audited, is tested, and that no school can reach.

## So P9 is not "build a solver"

It is, in order:

1. **the input path** — writers and screens for the six missing/partial
   inputs, which is where most of the work is;
2. **the wizard** that walks a coordinator through them and refuses to reach
   Generate while anything required is missing;
3. **wiring generation to a UI**, which mostly means routing what already
   exists;
4. **the outputs** — class, section, group, teacher, room, student — all read
   from `routine_slots`, never copied.

Two things are also worth fixing where they are found, because they mislead
the next reader:

- `solve.ts`'s header says double periods are "deliberately out of scope",
  and lines 65–223 implement them. The comment is stale.
- `tenants.weekend_days` and `shifts` are platform-owned by migration 069.
  Working days are a P9-1 input, so either the school gets a writer for them
  or the wizard has to say the operator sets them. That is a decision, not an
  oversight, and it is taken in P9-1 rather than assumed here.

---

# P9-1 — the input the generator could not work without (2026-09-06)

P9-0 concluded that P9 is the input path, not a solver rewrite. This is the
first and largest piece of that path.

## Two defects the inventory found before any wizard existed

**`B-89` — a student could name themselves the teacher of any section.**
`section_subject_teachers` carried one policy: `tenant_isolation`, PERMISSIVE,
FOR ALL. Tenant-match was the entire test, proved live as `app.role='student'`
(`INSERT 0 1`, then `DELETE 1`). Load-bearing rather than theoretical, because
`solve.ts:loadDemand` reads that table **and nothing else** to decide what a
timetable must contain.

Migration 072 gives it per-command scopes: INSERT and UPDATE for the three
roles that may author a routine, DELETE for **nobody** — it is a history table
and erasing a row erases the fact that somebody taught a class. `dept_head` is
deliberately excluded: the table has no department column to scope them by, so
admitting them would admit them to every subject in the school.

**`B-90` — and the DELETE ban immediately exposed a second one.** `loadDemand`
filtered on year and shift and not on `ended_on IS NULL`, so every teacher who
had ever held a subject was still returned as live demand. A school in its
third year would get three sets of Bangla periods, one per reassignment.

It had never fired because **nothing in this repository had ever produced a
closed row** — every fixture DELETEd instead of closing, so the history table
had no history and the missing filter could not be wrong. Forcing the fixtures
to close rows surfaced it within minutes. A guard that makes a latent defect
reachable is doing its job.

Separately: migrations 067–072 were unregistered in the migration-status
probe, whose own warning says an unchecked migration "reports as neither
applied nor pending, which is the worst answer". Six shipped security scopes.
All registered; the probe gained `column` and `trigger` sentinel kinds. 72/72.

## The writer, and why it is a matrix

`GET/POST /api/v1/rms/assignments`. A coordinator holds one class in their
head — "class 9: who takes maths in ক, in খ?" — not "assignment 41 of 800".
So the grid is subjects down and sections across, one class at a time, which
is the sheet already pinned up in the office. Eighty sections by ten subjects
is eight hundred decisions; one request each would be the difference between
an afternoon and a week.

The grid is built from the **curriculum** (`class_subjects`), not from the
assignments that exist, so the subjects nobody teaches yet are the visible
thing. `progress {required, assigned}` is computed server-side, because P9-2's
rule is that nobody reaches Generate without knowing what is missing, and a
count computed in the browser can drift from the truth.

Editing **closes and reopens** rather than overwriting. Clearing a cell closes
without reopening: the class still studies the subject, nobody holds it, and
the generator reports it as unplaced demand rather than skipping it silently.
Saving an unchanged grid writes nothing, or re-saving would fill the history
with churn that means nothing to whoever reads it later.

## The screen, and the bug only a browser could show

Both layouts are rendered and CSS picks one — a matrix does not survive 360px,
so the narrow shape is a card per subject. That means **every cell exists
twice**, and editing one left its twin showing the old teacher: invisible on a
phone, invisible on a desktop, and wrong the moment a tablet crosses the
breakpoint. Found by driving the real screen. The change handler now moves
both, and a test pins it.

`assignments-view.ts` is HOMEWORK (বাড়ির কাজ) and has been since R-2, which I
discovered by overwriting it. Restored from git immediately; nothing was lost,
and the collision is recorded in the new file's header.

## Evidence

- **1809 tests, all passing** — 11 API, 10 view, 7 scope
- 26/26 SQL suites · typecheck 0/0/0 across three CI configs · 72/72 migrations
- Browser: 12 cells, three teachers assigned and saved, progress ০ → ৩ / ১২,
  rows verified in the database; at 375px the matrix hides, the cards show,
  and nothing scrolls sideways
- The typecheck guard refused the commit until the new test file was
  re-baselined deliberately (`apps/pwa/test` is covered by no tsconfig — B-32).
  71 → 72, recorded rather than waved through
- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`

## P9 is PARTIAL, and this is what remains

Delivered: P9-0 (inventory), the security and correctness fixes it found, and
P9-1's input model end to end.

Not started: the wizard (P9-2), wiring generation to a UI (P9-3, plus the
one-minute measurement at six scales), surfacing explainability (P9-4 — the
API and view exist and are reachable only by a `?routineId=` nothing hands
out), editor locking and undo (P9-5), scoped re-solve (P9-6), the publish
lifecycle UI (P9-7), the class/group/section/teacher/room outputs (P9-8), and
print (P9-9).

Still SQL-only among the solver's other inputs, and therefore still blocking a
COMPLETE verdict: the bell-times editor (`period_definitions`), the subject
demand editor (`class_subjects.periods_per_week`), teacher availability, and
working days (`tenants.weekend_days`, which migration 069 makes platform-owned
— a decision P9-1 deliberately did not pre-empt).

---

# P9-2 — the setup wizard, and the last SQL-only routine inputs (2026-09-06)

P9-0 concluded the solver was built and its inputs were unreachable. P9-1 gave
the biggest one a writer. This closes the rest.

## Ownership, recorded once so it stops being re-litigated

| input | who manages it | required? | how it is set |
|---|---|---|---|
| working days (`tenants.weekend_days`) | **PLATFORM** | required | migration 069's trigger refuses it from a school account. The wizard shows it read-only and names shikhonBD |
| shifts (`tenants.shifts`) | **PLATFORM** | required | same trigger, same reason |
| bell times (`period_definitions`) | institution | **required** | **new in P9-2** — `POST /rms/setup {step:'periods'}` |
| subject demand (`class_subjects.periods_per_week`) | institution | **required** | **new in P9-2** — seeded by provisioning, now editable |
| teacher availability (`teacher_availability`) | institution | optional | **new in P9-2** — supports `unavailable`, `preferred`, `admin_duty` |
| teaching assignments (`section_subject_teachers`) | institution | **required** | P9-1 |
| rooms | institution | **required** | A4 / B-49 |
| classes, sections | institution | **required** | `ops-svc/api/structure.ts` |
| subjects | derived | required | seeded from the NCTB catalogue by `provision_tenant` |
| teacher competencies | institution | optional | still SQL-only — used only as a HINT in the assignment picker, never as a filter, so it blocks nothing |

## Two more of the same security hole

`class_subjects` and `teacher_availability` carried `tenant_isolation` and
nothing else. Proved live as `app.role='student'`:

```
UPDATE class_subjects SET periods_per_week = 20   ->  UPDATE 12
INSERT INTO teacher_availability … 'unavailable'  ->  INSERT 0 1
```

Twelve rows of a real school's curriculum, rewritten by a student. Between
these two tables the school's timetable size and its forbidden hours are
decided, so a student setting every subject to twenty periods a week would
make the week unsolvable — and the failure would read as the solver's fault.
Migration 073 (`B-92`).

That is **four for four** — B-53, B-77, B-89, B-92 — so `B-91` now records the
mechanism instead of the instance: a table gets per-command scopes when a
phase finally writes to it, which means the tables nobody could write were
never examined, and those were exactly the ones that most needed scoping. The
sweep belongs in `schema_lint.sql` once triaged.

**`B-93`**: `period_definitions` had nothing stopping period 3 running
10:00–11:00 while period 4 ran 10:30–11:30. The solver books by TIME INTERVAL
(F-506), so two overlapping definitions in one template are mutually exclusive
for every teacher — an unfillable timetable from a bell schedule that looked
fine. A GiST EXCLUDE now refuses it, partitioned by template so a morning and
a day shift may still overlap each other. A4's fixture had been *relying* on
the gap; it now uses a real consecutive schedule and reaches its three clashes
in the SAME period, which is the real-world shape of each.

## The wizard is a checklist, and that is the design

The brief proposes step → review → complete → next. A school's data does not
arrive in that order: the rooms are from last year, the curriculum was seeded
at provisioning, and the thing genuinely missing is usually the assignments. A
linear flow would march a coordinator through five correct screens to reach
the sixth.

So: every step, its state, and one sentence saying what would fix it. The step
order is still the dependency order, so top-to-bottom remains valid for a
school starting from nothing.

**Three states, not two.** `warn` is what makes the one-minute promise honest.
No availability recorded means "everyone is free all week" — the right default
for a first run. Making it a blocker would send a school off to do an
afternoon of optional data entry before seeing anything work.

**Readiness is computed server-side, once.** Two people editing at once would
make a browser count disagree with the database, and being trusted about what
is missing is this screen's only job.

**Three steps open inline** (the ones that had no screen at all); the rest link
out to screens that already exist. A wizard copy of the assignment matrix
would be a second implementation, and the second one is always the one that
rots.

## Validation says what happened

Browser-verified, and this is the §10 example working:

> "সমাবেশ" (08:00–08:30) এবং "১ম" (08:20–09:00) একই সময়ে পড়ছে

Both periods, both times, in Bangla — and ten rows of bell times still on
screen to correct, because a refused save must never cost an afternoon.

## Evidence

- **1834 tests, all passing** — 16 API (incl. cross-tenant), 10 view
- 26/26 SQL suites · typecheck 0/0/0 across three CI configs · 73/73 migrations
- Browser, real school: 5 working days · 7 teaching periods · 12 subjects /
  48 weekly periods · assignments **3 of 12 BLOCKED** · availability WARN ·
  rooms BLOCKED · `canGenerate false`
- **Nine widths 360–1600**: no horizontal scroll at any of them, all 8 cards
  render
- **Dark** via `data-theme`: card text 13.36:1, status badges 6.11:1 and
  6.41:1 — AA with room
- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`

## Honest limits

**An open editor's unsaved rows are lost on navigate.** Each step saves to the
server and readiness is server truth, so leaving and returning is safe — but
the periods editor holds its rows in memory until Save, and there is no
before-unload guard on this screen (`teaching-assignments-view` has
`hasUnsavedChanges()`; this one does not). Recorded rather than claimed.

**`teacher_competencies` remains SQL-only.** It is used as a HINT in the
assignment picker — a teacher known to take a subject is marked ✓ and every
other teacher stays choosable — so it gates nothing and blocks no generation.
A writer for it is a P9-3-or-later convenience, not a gap in the input path.

# P9-3 — the one press, and the shift that could not see the other (2026-09-06)

P9-0 found the solver built and its inputs unreachable. P9-1 and P9-2 gave the
inputs writers. This is READY → GENERATE → RESULT: a coordinator presses one
button and the institution has a timetable.

`POST /api/v1/rms/generate { yearId }` runs the readiness gate the wizard
shows, finds or makes a draft per shift, calls `RmsSolver` unchanged once per
shift, and returns one summary. `GET` re-reads it from the database so a
refresh is not an empty page. No second solver was written, and the existing
one changed by one optional parameter.

## The benchmark found a defect the tests could not

§8 made a realistic benchmark mandatory, so `scripts/routine-benchmark.mjs`
seeds five institutions — a village secondary, an urban school, an 80-section
two-shift school, a 120-section two-shift college, a dakhil madrasa — and
drives the real handler over each.

The first full run reported **40 stored room double-bookings** in the large
school and 4 in the college, while the API's summary said `hardConflicts: 0`.
Every one was a morning slot and a day slot in the same room at the shift
handover. Three things had lined up:

**The solver books against ACTIVE routines only.** F-506's cross-shift
awareness was written when the only way to have a second shift was to publish
it first. P9-3 creates a draft for every shift in one action, so the day shift
could not see the morning shift.

**The database did not object, and was right not to.** Read the three
predicates and they do not say the same thing:

```
rs_no_section_double_booking  … WHERE status='active'
rs_no_teacher_double_booking  … WHERE status='active' AND routine_status='active'
rs_no_room_double_booking     … ditto
```

A section is protected inside its own routine at every status; teacher and
room only once the routine is ACTIVE. That gap is deliberate — two rival
drafts of one shift must not block each other — and `editor.ts:findClash`
already compensates for exactly it in manual authoring, with a comment saying
so. The solver had no such compensation.

**And `hardConflicts` was a hard-coded `0`** with a comment explaining why it
could never be anything else. It was wrong for a draft, and it was the number
on the screen.

Three fixes, one per cause:

- `solve()` gained `opts.alsoBookedAgainst` — the sibling drafts of this run.
  Deliberately a parameter and not "every draft in the year": a year
  accumulates abandoned drafts, and booking against all of them would have
  the solver believe the school is full.
- `generate.ts` counts hard conflicts by querying the stored rows, and a
  non-zero count outranks everything else in the verdict sentence, because a
  routine carrying one cannot be published.
- A test plants a real conflict in a draft and requires the counter to find
  it. A zero from a detector that can only return zero is worth nothing.

## The alphabet was making a scheduling decision

`shiftsOf` selected `shift::text` and ordered by it, so `day` was solved
before `morning` and won every contended room — the morning shift lost its
last period to a shift that had not started yet. `shift_code` is declared
`morning, day, evening, single`, which is clock order, so it now orders by the
enum.

The output column is no longer called `shift`: `ORDER BY` resolves an output
alias before an input column, and `SELECT shift::text AS shift … ORDER BY
shift` silently restored the bug once already.

## Measured, not claimed

Local container. No network, no TLS, no browser render — the split §9 asks
for exists so the missing piece stays visible.

| profile | sections | teachers | rooms | shifts | demand | placed | p50 | p95 | hard |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| small school | 20 | 23 | 22 | 1 | 580 | 560 | 1.04s | 1.06s | 0 |
| medium school | 40 | 45 | 43 | 1 | 1160 | 1125 | 2.11s | 2.21s | 0 |
| large school | 80 | 92 | 43 | 2 | 2360 | 2319 | 4.23s | 4.26s | 0 |
| college | 120 | 139 | 77 | 2 | 3600 | 3470 | 6.43s | 6.43s | 0 |
| madrasa | 30 | 41 | 30 | 1 | 1050 | 1050 | 2.00s | 2.03s | 0 |

Three repeats each, every one from an empty routine — the solver is
idempotent, so re-running over a full one places nothing and returns in
milliseconds, which would be a lovely number and a lie.

**The 60-second target is met locally and is NOT yet proven end to end.**
These numbers exclude network latency to a VPS, TLS, and the browser's render.
No claim about the product's real one-minute promise is made here.

The verification query was itself the bottleneck: the obvious pairwise
self-join cost **4.3 of the college's 12.5 seconds**, because the partial GiST
indexes carry `routine_status = 'active'` and these are drafts. A window
function over each (resource, day) does it in one pass, and the college run
dropped to 6.4s. The benchmark still runs the pairwise form as an independent
check.

## The screen

**No fabricated progress.** `POST /rms/generate` is one blocking request with
no stream and no job id, so the wait shows a spinner, a true elapsed second
count, and a sentence saying why there is no percentage.
`ui/feedback.ts:progress` is deliberately not imported, and a test asserts
there is no `role="progressbar"` on the page.

**A hard conflict outranks "all periods placed".** Leading with the cheerful
number would send someone to publish a routine that publish will refuse.

**Unplaced demand is a to-do list.** Every row names the class, the subject,
the teacher, how many periods are missing, and the reason in a sentence,
because the four solver reasons are four different errands —
`no_capable_room` (the school has no such room) and `no_free_capable_room`
(it has one and it is full) send a coordinator to opposite ends of the
building.

**No machine code reaches a person.** The browser showed
`"computer_lab" কক্ষে ৮০টি পিরিয়ড দরকার` — the raw capability string, which
is whatever an IT admin typed into `subjects.requires_capability`, so no
lookup table could translate it. What can be said is which subjects asked for
it, and the endpoint now says that instead. The solver's own `detailBn` is
untouched; other screens read it.

## Two things the browser found that reading would not have

**The routine screens were being served from cache.** `/api/v1/rms/` as a
whole is `stale-while-revalidate`, which is right for a published timetable
and wrong for a register read immediately before a write and re-read after
it. P0 already carved out `/rms/rooms` and `/rms/editor` for that exact
reason, in those words. `/rms/setup`, `/rms/generate` and `/rms/assignments`
are the same shape and are now carved out too — a stale readiness checklist
tells a school it is ready after someone emptied the room list, and the person
believes it until the server refuses.

Recorded honestly: one stale render was observed in the browser and the
carve-out is justified by the P0 precedent, but the observation was not
cleanly isolated to the service worker (navigating to an identical hash URL is
a no-op, which confounded one reading). What IS verified: with the carve-out
in place, a routine deleted from the database behind the browser's back
disappears from the screen on the next load.

**Three CSS classes had no rule behind them.** `.ui-stack` (P9-1),
`.ui-cell-line`, `.ui-cell-meta` and `.setup-period-row` (P9-2) were layout
hooks that rendered as bare block elements — on a phone, five bell-time inputs
became five full-width boxes with no gap. Added to `app.css` with the
360px-first grid the period editor needed.

## Evidence

- **1850 tests, all passing** across 13 workspaces — 13 new API (incl. the
  two-shift regression, the planted-conflict detector, cross-tenant), 11 new
  view
- 26/26 SQL suites · typecheck 0/0/0 across three CI configs
- **Security probe 29/29** against a running deployment (`local-docker-p9-3`)
- Browser, real 40-section school through the real API: READY → the generating
  state with a live elapsed counter → `১১৬০টির মধ্যে ১১২৫টি বসানো হয়েছে`,
  19 named unplaced demands, `কঠিন শর্ত লঙ্ঘন ০`
- **Eight widths 360–1600**: no horizontal overflow, no tap target under 44px,
  no raw uuid, no Latin numeral before a Bangla counter, heading order
  H1→H2→H3→H2
- **Dark** via `data-theme`: body `#1B1714`, card `#241E1A`, text `#EDE7DA`,
  quiet text `#BFB3A4` — ~8:1 for the quietest pair
- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`

## Honest limits

**The one-minute promise is proven locally only.** Network, TLS and render are
not in any number above. What is proven: the server side of a 120-section
two-shift college finishes in 6.4 seconds at p95, which leaves the whole
remaining budget to the parts not measured.

**`hardConflicts` is counted over the drafts this run touched**, not over the
whole year. That is the right scope for the sentence it produces — "this
generation left a conflict" — but it is not a school-wide audit, and a
conflict between a draft and an unrelated ACTIVE routine would be caught by
the database at publish rather than by this number.

**Publish, scoped re-solve and the printed grid remain P9-4 through P9-9.**
Generation writes draft slots. Nothing here activates a routine.

---

# P9-4 — one code for four problems (2026-09-07)

P9-3 delivered generation and, with it, a screen that said `no_free_slot`
against a shortfall. That is one word for four entirely different problems —
the section's week was full, the teacher was teaching elsewhere, the teacher
had blocked the hour, the other shift held the only suitable room — and each
sends a coordinator somewhere else. This is the phase that tells them which.

## The inventory came first, and it changed the shape of the work

Three explainers already existed and none was rebuilt:

| what | where | state |
|---|---|---|
| why THIS teacher, this room, for a PLACED lesson (F-503) | `api/generation.ts:explainSlot` | READY — evidence-based, counts qualified and free teachers before it claims necessity |
| every soft constraint traded away (F-505) | `src/soft-constraints.ts` | READY — six rules, each naming a person or a section, cause stated only when computable |
| rules this build cannot check | `soft-constraints.ts:notEvaluated` | READY |
| why a demand was NOT placed | — | **MISSING**, and the reason P9-4 exists |

So P9-4 is the fourth question, plus the presentation layer the other three
turned out to need.

## The solver knew the answer and threw it away

`solve.ts` tests each guard in turn — section busy, teacher busy, teacher
unavailable, no free room — and reports a single `reason` derived from
whether a capability was involved. The information was already computed.

`BlockerTally` keeps it: how many of the exhaustive pass's candidate hours
each guard rejected, and how many of those were held by ANOTHER SHIFT's
routine. Written only on the path where a candidate has already been
rejected, so no placement decision changes — every solver suite passed
unaltered, which is the property that mattered.

`IntervalBook` gained an owner per interval, tagged with the shift of the
routine that holds it. §17's rule was "do not change the solver algorithm
unless required to expose existing structured explanation data", and this is
exactly that: the same intervals, now able to say who booked them.

## Claim → evidence, and it is enforced by the shape of the code

`src/explain.ts` is pure — no database, no clock, no ids. It takes named rows
and returns sentences, which is what lets 25 tests exercise the RULES against
hand-written failures rather than against whatever the solver produced today.

Three properties, each with a test that would catch its loss:

**No claim without a counter.** Where the tally is empty — a
`no_contiguous_pair` finding is reported before the hour search ever runs —
the explanation says "কোন বাধায় আটকেছে তা এই রানে আলাদা করে নির্ণয় করা যায়নি"
and offers nothing. Guessing at the commonest cause would be indistinguishable
from knowing, which is the whole failure mode §8 is about.

**No suggestion that cannot be acted on.** A school with one laboratory is
told to add another; a school with four is told to move a class between them.
The difference is `capableRooms`, carried from the shortage rows the same run
already computed. A school with none is never told to rearrange its
timetable, because nothing about a timetable can conjure a laboratory.

**Every sentence carries its denominator.** "৩৫টি সম্ভাব্য সময়ের মধ্যে ৩০টিতে
তিনি অন্য শাখায় ক্লাস নিচ্ছিলেন" is checkable. "The teacher was busy" is not.

## Cross-shift, proved on the real fixture

§11 asked for it because P9-3 found a two-shift bug. The two-shift regression
school — two rooms, four sections, an overlapping handover — now returns:

> সকাল শিফটের রুটিন ওই সময়ে কক্ষটি ধরে রেখেছিল

with the count behind it, and a suggestion naming that shift. Asserted
against the real solver and a real database, not a fixture of the shape.
An ordinary teacher clash with no foreign owner stays `teacher_conflict`;
`crossShift` is incremented only when the blocking interval belongs to
another routine.

## 1,516 findings is not an explanation

The 80-section benchmark, deliberately over-subscribed, put **1,516
interactive rows** on the page: forty saying the same thing about the same
subject, and 1,358 soft trades one per teacher. Close to a megabyte on a 2G
connection, and a list nobody reads at all.

Grouping is server-side, on two keys and only after each finding's category
is decided, so a group is genuinely one cause:

- unplaced demands on (category, subject) — "চারু ও কারুকলা — ৪০টি শাখায় মোট
  ১৬০টি পিরিয়ড বসেনি", with the sections named in the drawer
- soft trades on their rule, with every individual sentence kept one level in,
  because F-505's "nothing is silently accepted" still holds

Two of a kind stay separate; grouping starts at three. Two DIFFERENT walls
under one subject stay apart, because a group must be one problem.

**1,516 → 12 rows**, observed in the browser. A client-side cap of 25 per
severity remains as a backstop against a category nobody has grouped yet.

## The explanation must not be paid for by the thing it explains

The first tally cost the college profile **8.89s p95 against P9-3's 6.43s** —
a 38% tax, because the guard asked the interval list twice (once to decide,
once to find the owner) and allocated an array per rejected hour.
`blockingOwner()` answers both in one scan and allocates nothing:
**6.78s p95**, about 5% over P9-3. Measured with three repeats, each from an
empty routine.

| profile | sections | demand | placed | p95 | hard |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| small school | 20 | 580 | 556 | 1.29s | 0 |
| medium school | 40 | 1160 | 1125 | 2.40s | 0 |
| large school (2 shifts) | 80 | 2360 | 2325 | 5.03s | 0 |
| college (2 shifts) | 120 | 3600 | 3477 | 6.78s | 0 |
| madrasa | 30 | 1050 | 1050 | 1.98s | 0 |

Response sizes after the payload trim below: 19 / 23 / 25 / 70 / 11 kB.

**The one-minute target's status is unchanged: NOT PROVEN END TO END.** These
are local container numbers with no network, no TLS and no browser render,
exactly as P9-3 recorded them.

## The response was five sixths data nothing drew

Measuring the payload after grouping found the college profile still shipping
**375 kB**. The blocker tallies were 175 kB of it and the solver's full
soft-violation list — 1,172 sentences — most of the rest. The screen draws
neither: the trades are in `explanations`, already grouped, and the complete
list is served by the F-503 explainer from `routines.soft_violations` where
the solver persisted it.

Both are now consumed server-side and dropped before the response is built.
**375 kB → 70 kB** on the college profile, 73 → 19 kB on the small school.
On a 2G connection that is the difference between a wait and a failure, and
§1's "do not expose solver internals" says the same thing for a different
reason.

## §9's audit found the same string in a second place

P9-3 fixed `"computer_lab"` in `generate.ts`. The audit found it also reaching
the F-503 explainer screen, from `routines.soft_violations` where `solve.ts`
had written it — so fixing the writer would not have fixed a row already in
the database.

`src/presentation.ts` is now the single mapping, and it is a map AND a
scrubber for a reason: `rooms.capabilities` is `text[]` with no vocabulary,
so a lookup table can never be complete and one that falls through to the raw
code is the bug itself. Known codes get their Bangla name; anything else
becomes "বিশেষ কক্ষ" — less specific, and true. Stored sentences are rewritten
on the way out.

A school's own room codes ("R-1", "ভবন-২") are deliberately left alone:
scrubbing those would be the opposite failure.

## Two defects fixed on the way

**`generation.ts` reported `hardViolations: 0` as a constant**, with a comment
explaining that the exclusion constraints made a violation unstorable — the
same claim P9-3 disproved for drafts, in the other reader of the same
routines. It is counted now, by the same window-function scan.

**The UI claimed "কোনো সমস্যা পাওয়া যায়নি" from an empty explanation list.**
Found by a P9-3 fixture that predates the field: a response from an older
build, or one that lost its explanations in transit, produced an empty array
beside a summary saying twelve periods were missing — and the reassuring
sentence was the only thing on screen that was wrong. The claim is now
checked against the summary before it is made.

## The screen

`routine-generate-view.ts` gained one card and one drawer. The four
overlapping sections it replaced — unplaced rows, shortages, soft trades,
optional gaps — were four lists saying related things with no order between
them.

Severity is a **word** before it is a colour (§14): "ঠিক করা দরকার" /
"সতর্কতা" / "তথ্য" in the accessible name of every row, with the left rail
reinforcing it. A red dot is invisible to a screen reader and to anyone who
cannot separate it from the amber one.

A school with nothing wrong gets a calm success note — and still sees what
was NOT checked, because "০ সমস্যা" otherwise means "০ of the rules we ran".

The drawer is `openDrawer`, so the dialog role, the focus trap and the return
of focus are the component's, not re-implemented. Sections in order: কারণ →
বর্তমান অবস্থা → প্রভাব → সম্ভাব্য সমাধান. Where nothing can honestly be
suggested it says so rather than showing an empty heading.

## Evidence

- **1886 tests, all passing** across 13 workspaces — 25 explanation-model and
  presentation tests (pure), 4 new API tests (cross-shift on the real
  two-shift fixture, role authorization across seven roles, solver internals
  kept off the wire), 8 new view tests
- 26/26 SQL suites · typecheck 0/0/0 across three CI configs · 73/73 migrations
- **Security probe 29/29** against a running deployment (`local-docker-p9-4`)
- Browser, 80-section two-shift school through the real API: 1,516 → **12
  findings**; drawer verified to carry all four sections with the server's own
  sentences; **second tenant** on the same browser sees its own four blocked
  steps and none of the first school's findings
- **Nine widths 360–1600**, list and drawer: no horizontal overflow, no tap
  target under 44px, no uuid, no snake_case, no `undefined`, no Latin numeral
  before a Bangla counter
- **Both themes** resolve real tokens: error rail `#B3392C` / `#E88C80`, warn
  `#7C5C1B` / `#D0A64B`, info `#38586B` / `#98B2C1`
- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`

## Honest limits

**The tally describes the search, not the school.** `teacherBusy: 30` means
thirty candidate hours were rejected because a teacher was teaching — it does
not mean the teacher is overloaded, and the explanation never says so. The
soft-constraint report is where load is judged.

**A group's evidence is one member's**, labelled as such
("প্রথম — ক-এর হিসাব; বাকিগুলোতেও একই বাধা"). The members share a category,
so the KIND of wall is true of all of them; the exact count is the
representative's.

**`explainSlot` still answers per placed slot only**, reached from the F-503
screen. Explaining a placement from the findings list would need a slot to
point at, and an unplaced demand has none.

**Suggestions are not applied.** Every one names a screen the coordinator
goes to. Acting on them from the drawer is P9-5's editor and P9-6's scoped
re-solve.

# B-104 — two schools, one browser (2026-09-07)

Found during P9-4 browser acceptance, fixed before P9-5.

## Root cause

The Cache API matches on URL alone unless the stored response carries a
`Vary` header. Ours do not. `sw.ts` did `cache.match(req)`, so the entry
cached for one school was served to whoever asked next, whatever token was on
the request.

That is invisible in the shape production is *designed* for — a school per
subdomain, where the browser partitions by origin — and wide open in the
shape production **actually ships today**: `/app?tid=<uuid>`, every school on
one origin, with subdomains recorded in the runbook as not ready and gated
behind an attestation.

Observed, not theorised: a session for the benchmark school first painted
against মনিপুর স্কুল's academic year id, cached minutes earlier in the same
browser. The readiness screen said "এই শিক্ষাবর্ষে কোনো শাখা নেই" because RLS
correctly returned nothing for a foreign year. **RLS held. The client did
not.** The devices this happens on are ordinary here: a Union Digital Centre,
a school's one office laptop, a teacher who works at two madrasas.

## The audit

| Cache / data | Tenant-scoped before? | Key | Risk | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SW `shikhon-data-v1` — `/academics/*`, `/rms/*`, `/ops/inbox`, `/ops/notices`, `/ops/calendar`, `/ops/brand*` | **NO** | URL | **HIGH** — first paint from another school's roster, routine, notices, calendar, hierarchy | tenant-keyed + purge |
| SW `shikhon-media-v1` — `/media/`, `/scripts/` | **NO** | URL | MEDIUM — answer scripts and photos; URLs embed unguessable ids, so a hit needs the exact URL | purge on switch |
| SW `shikhon-shell-v2` — precache, app shell, entry assets | n/a — the product's own code | URL | none | **unchanged, deliberately** |
| localStorage tier 2 — ~20 screen caches (`shikhon_sections_cache`, `shikhon_last_section`, `shikhon_last_roster`, `shikhon_last_class`, …) | **NO** | fixed | **HIGH** — cold-start paint from the previous school | purge on switch |
| localStorage tier 1 — `shikhon_auth` | holds `tenantId` | fixed | MEDIUM — the leaving school's token stays on the device | purge on switch |
| localStorage tier 4 — `shikhon_branding_<tid>` | **YES**, already | per tenant | none | unchanged |
| localStorage tier 4 — `shikhon_tid`, `shikhon_d`, theme, sidebar, textsize | device facts | fixed | none | unchanged |
| IndexedDB `shikhon` — outbox (tier 3) | **YES**, already | `opId`, every op carries `tenantId`; `ownedBy()` filters `claimBatch` and `counts` | none | unchanged, and never cleared |
| Demo keys | `/demo` only | fixed | none | unchanged |

Two of the nine were already right, and the reason matters: the outbox was
designed for a shared device from the start (`OpOwner` is `{tenantId,
actorId}`), and branding was already one key per school because it is public
data served before anybody signs in.

## Architecture — C and A together, and both are needed

**C, tenant-aware cache keys**, is what makes a cross-tenant hit impossible.
`tenantCacheKey()` appends the school to the key, so another school's request
produces a different key and simply misses. This is not a check somebody must
remember to write — it cannot be expressed. It holds during a switch, before
any purge has finished, and a later edit cannot reintroduce the bug by
forgetting a comparison.

**A, purge on switch**, is what makes "the other school's data is gone" true
rather than merely "unreachable". `isTenantSwitch()` decides; the existing
B-8 `purgeLocalData` does the work, which is the module built for exactly
this and already tested.

**B, partitioned cache names**, was rejected: it would need the tenant woven
into ~20 localStorage keys and the IndexedDB name too, which is the general
cache refactor §12 forbids.

Rejected outright: `Vary: Authorization`. Correct, and it would disable the
cache — the token rotates every fifteen minutes, so every refresh would miss,
and the offline story this product is built around would quietly die.

The shell and media buckets are deliberately NOT partitioned. `/app.js` and
the precached shell are the product's own code, identical for every school;
keying them per tenant would re-download the whole application on exactly the
devices least able to afford it.

## The ordering, which is the whole point

```
resolve ?tid=  →  compare with stored tid AND with the open session
               →  sweepNow()            (synchronous — no await, no gap)
               →  purgeLocalData()      (async; the key covers this window)
               →  write the new tid
               →  screens may now read
```

It sits at module top level in `app.ts`, not inside `main()`, and **before**
`localStorage.setItem('shikhon_tid', …)` — which would otherwise destroy the
evidence the comparison needs. No fetch has been issued at that point.

`isTenantSwitch` is conservative by design: only a load that NAMES a school
can declare a change. A PWA reopened from the home screen with no query
string is the same school it was yesterday, and treating that as a switch
would drop the offline cache of every installed device, every day.

## Proof

Real browser, real service worker, real Cache API, two real schools on one
origin.

**Negative test (§9/§10).** Warm A's cache, then read the identical URLs as
B, before B has fetched anything:

```
keys after warming A:
  /api/v1/academics/hierarchy?__t=7c9b0000-…-bea0
  /api/v1/ops/notices?__t=7c9b0000-…-bea0
  /api/v1/ops/calendar?month=2026-09&__t=7c9b0000-…-bea0
B reading the same three: null, null, null
```

Both directions, across ten endpoints, asserted in
`apps/pwa/test/tenant-cache-isolation.test.ts` against a fake Cache that
reproduces the real matching rule — URL only, headers ignored — because a
fake that quietly matched on headers would pass a broken implementation.

**Coexistence.** With both warmed, `aYear = …bea2`, `bYear = 850555c9…`:
different data, each school seeing only its own.

**Switch, both directions (§5).** `?tid=A` → `?tid=B`: tab title became
**মনিপুর স্কুল**, `shikhon_auth` gone, `shikhon_sections_cache` gone, A's six
cache entries gone, `shikhon_d` and `shikhon_theme` kept. `?tid=B` → `?tid=A`:
title **ছোট স্কুল — গ্রামীণ মাধ্যমিক**, B's session and screen cache gone,
`offline_AwouldSeeB: false`.

**Offline (§6), with the server actually stopped:**

```
A offline: ok: true,  year: 7c9b0000-…-bea2      ← its own data, as designed
B offline: fetch failed entirely                  ← nothing, rather than A's
```

That is the requirement exactly: the school that owns the cache keeps working
offline, and the other one gets nothing rather than somebody else's roster.

## Performance

No extra network requests. The key changes; the number of fetches does not.
A device that never switches schools sees no change at all.

The cost falls only where a device actually serves two institutions: after a
switch, the arriving school re-downloads its reference data once. That is
§3's stated priority applied — no cross-tenant data first, offline second —
and it is the trade the purge buys, since the keying alone would have let
both caches sit on the device indefinitely.

One benign effect worth recording: a fetch issued in the first moments after
a switch can have its cache entry deleted by the still-running purge, so it
is re-fetched next time. Observed during acceptance. A miss, never a wrong
answer.

## Evidence

- **1900 tests, all passing** across 13 workspaces — 14 new in
  `tenant-cache-isolation.test.ts`
- 26/26 SQL suites, run **three times**; the isolation and surface suites run
  three times
- typecheck 0/0/0 across three CI configs · 73/73 migrations · build clean
- **Security probe 29/29** against a running deployment (`local-docker-b104`)
- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`

## Honest limits

**The `/media/` and `/scripts/` buckets are cleared on switch, not keyed.**
Their URLs embed unguessable ids, so serving one across tenants requires
already knowing the other school's URL. Keying them would have meant
threading the header through non-API asset requests, which is the refactor
§12 rules out; the purge covers the realistic case.

**Subdomain deployments were already safe** and are unaffected. This fix is
for the address production actually uses today.

**The outbox is untouched**, as it must be: tier 3 is never cleared by
anything, and it did not need to be — `ownedBy()` has scoped it by tenant
since it was written.

# P9-5 — the lock nobody could set (2026-09-07)

## The audit came first, and most of the editor already existed

| capability | state before P9-5 | where |
|---|---|---|
| create routine, place, assign, move, remove | **built** | `api/editor.ts`, A4 |
| clash detection, named in Bangla | **built** | the three GiST constraints + `explainConflict` |
| teacher / room / subject / section pickers | **built** | `loadGrid` + the lesson drawer |
| draft vs published separation | **built** | `EDITABLE = draft \| review`; publish refuses to mutate active |
| tap-to-move grid, keyboard-equal | **built** | `routine-editor-view.ts` |
| **lock (`is_pinned`)** | **enforced, unwritable** | schema 006; `move`/`remove` refuse it; nothing could SET it |
| **undo** | absent | — |
| **optimistic concurrency** | `row_version` incremented by every mutation, **checked by none** | — |
| **unsaved-changes guard** | absent on this screen | `teaching-assignments-view` had one |
| **open from the generation result** | absent | the button went to whichever section the picker defaulted to |

So P9-5 is four things, not a rebuild.

## The lock was a rule the product had and no school could use

`routine_slots.is_pinned` has carried the comment "solver may not move it"
since migration 006. `move` and `remove` have refused to touch a pinned slot
for as long. `loadGrid` returned it, the grid rendered `data-pinned`. And
there was no writer — the same shape P9-1 found in `section_subject_teachers`
and P9-2 found in the bell schedule: an enforced control nobody could reach.

`lock` and `unlock` are that writer. No migration was needed; the column and
its enforcement were already there.

**The first version made a lock a one-way door.** `pick()` refused to select
a pinned slot — sensible, since it cannot be moved — which meant its action
bar never opened, so the only control that could UNLOCK it was unreachable. A
pinned lesson is now selectable and not movable, and the bar says which.

**And two buttons read as the same word.** The action row had "সরান" (remove
the lesson) beside "পিন সরান" (remove the pin). A coordinator scanning that
row deletes a class they meant to unlock. The unlock is "পিন খুলুন".

## Undo: the inverse is computed when the edit is made

Migration 074 adds `routine_edit_log`. Every mutation records how to reverse
itself **while the old row is still in front of us** — deriving the inverse at
undo time would mean reading a row later edits may have moved and reversing
it into state it never came from, which is how an undo feature becomes the
thing that loses the work.

It is not `audit.activity_log`, and that was the first idea. Two reasons:
that table's `before` payloads are written for a reader, not a replay
(`remove` records `{subjectBn}` — enough to understand, nowhere near enough
to restore); and an audit log another feature writes against, whose rows
change meaning when something marks them consumed, stops being the evidence
it exists to be.

**A stack, not a history.** Undo claims the newest un-undone entry, applies
its inverse, marks it consumed, and appends nothing — so there is no redo.
Deliberate: a redo stack is a second mechanism to get wrong for a case ("I
went one too far") a coordinator solves by making the edit again.

**Bounded by DEPTH, and the bound is correctness.** `UNDO_DEPTH = 12`.
Nothing is ever deleted; the limit is how far back the editor offers to go,
because an inverse written forty edits ago describes a routine that no longer
exists.

**`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`** on the claim: two coordinators pressing undo
together take two different entries rather than both reversing the same edit.

**Nothing may delete an entry** — `edit_log_delete_scope USING (false)`, for
everyone including the owner under `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. Found by this
phase's own test fixture, which used DELETE, removed nothing, and let every
test inherit the previous one's stack. The policy was right; the fixture was
wrong, and there is now a test asserting the policy holds.

## Two operators, and the second one used to win silently

`row_version` has been incremented by every editor mutation since A4 and
checked by nothing. So two coordinators on one routine overwrote each other,
last write wins, and the loser was never told.

`requireVersion` refuses an edit made against a version the caller has not
seen. Optional on purpose — a caller that sends none keeps the old behaviour,
so this is not a breaking change to an endpoint other screens already use —
and the editor always sends one.

The message does not name who changed it, because `routine_slots` has no
`updated_by` and `audit.activity_log` is where that lives. A sentence naming
a person would be a claim the table cannot support.

## A guard nobody asked

`hasUnsavedChanges()` existed on TWO views and nothing ever called either —
the assignment matrix since P9-1, the routine editor as of this phase's first
draft. That is the same defect as the lock: a control that exists, is
correct, and is unreachable.

`ShellRoute` gained `guardLeave(resume) => boolean`. It is optional and every
other route omits it, so nothing else changed. The fiddly part is that the
hash has ALREADY changed by the time the shell hears about it, so blocking
means putting the address bar back — otherwise it says the person is
somewhere they are not and the back button lands somewhere neither of us
expects. Both views are wired to it.

Its tests found a second thing: every `Shell` listens on the GLOBAL
`hashchange`, so a shell left alive by an earlier test answered later tests'
navigations too. The existing shell tests never noticed because they only
inspect the first render. The fixture now destroys the previous shell.

## Found on the way

**`move` wrote no audit entry at all.** place, assign and remove all did.
Noticed while adding the undo log, which needed the same before-state the
audit trail should always have had.

**The grid rendered Latin clock times.** `13:00` in the one always-visible
column of a Bangla timetable. `formatTime(…, 'bn')` is the project's
convention and this screen was not using it.

## Evidence

- **1936 tests, all passing** across 13 workspaces — 18 new API
  (`editor-lock-undo.test.ts`), 13 new view, 5 new shell-guard
- 26/26 SQL suites run **three times**; the two editor suites three times
- typecheck 0/0/0 · build clean · **74/74 migrations**, and 074 proved
  down → detected as MISSING → up → fully migrated
- **Security probe 29/29** against a running deployment (`local-docker-p9-5`)
- Browser, real API, a generated 20-section school: editor opened on the
  section it was given (ষষ্ঠ-ক, 29 filled cells) → select → lock → the cell
  shows **🔒 পিন করা** and the bar explains the consequence → move refused
  locally with "আগে পিন সরান" → remove disabled → undo names
  **"ষষ্ঠ-ক · বাংলা · রবি ১ নম্বর পিরিয়ড"** and reverses it → a real move,
  then undo, and the grid returns
- **Concurrency, live:** two moves at the same rendered version → `200`, then
  `409 stale_slot` with the Bangla sentence
- **Tenant isolation, live:** school B holding A's slot and routine ids gets
  404 on lock, unlock, undo and move; reading A's section as B returns an
  empty grid and `routine: null`
- **Nine widths 360–1600**: no horizontal overflow (the grid scrolls inside
  its own `table-scroll`, as §11 intends), no tap target under 44px, no uuid,
  no `undefined`
- **Both themes**: a pinned cell is distinct from a plain one — light
  `#FFFFFF` vs `#E9E3D4`, dark `#241E1A` vs `#302821` — and the WORD is
  present in both, so the colour is a reinforcement
- **§21 performance, measured:** the editor grid is flat as the school grows —
  p50 **11 / 13 / 11 / 13 ms** at 20 / 40 / 80 / 120 sections (560 → 3,464
  slots in the school). It is scoped to one section's week and the undo query
  is `LIMIT 12`, so nothing in it grows with the institution
- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`

## Honest limits

**Undo has no redo**, and the depth is 12. Both are deliberate and both are
tested so they cannot become accidents.

**Undo does not cross a publish.** The editor works on a draft; publishing
ends the stack's usefulness because the slots it describes are no longer
editable. Attempting it returns `routine_not_editable`.

**A double period still cannot be moved**, by hand or by undo — `move` has
refused to split one since §8.1 and that is unchanged. Moving the pair as a
unit remains unimplemented, and is recorded rather than hidden.

**The unsaved-changes guard covers the lesson DRAWER, not the grid**, and
that is the whole of what can be lost: every grid edit is written to the
server as it is made.

**Locks are structurally ready for P9-6** and nothing more was built for it.
`is_pinned` is what a scoped re-solve will read to decide what to leave
alone; no temporary mechanism was introduced that P9-6 would have to replace.

---

# P9-6 — the scoped re-solve that needed no second solver (2026-09-07)

## The mechanism was already in the building

`RmsSolver` places `periodsPerWeek − alreadyPlaced` for each (section,
subject), counting whatever is active in the routine. So a fully-placed
routine is one it will not touch, and a routine missing four lessons is one
it will place four lessons into.

That makes "re-solve only the affected area" a two-line idea: **remove the
affected slots, run the solver you already have.** Every constraint, every
clash check, every room match, every explanation is the existing one, and a
change to any of them changes this too. §1 said not to build a second solver;
there was never a reason to.

## The dependency closure is the affected set, and nothing beyond it

§3 asks for the closure and warns against re-solving an arbitrary percentage,
which reads as a tension until you notice that the solver only ever ADDS into
free hours — it cannot displace a lesson that stayed. Freeing Rahim's
Wednesday hour therefore cannot cascade into anyone else's week: the only
demands short after the removal are the ones removed, and the only slots that
move are theirs.

Anything wider would be movement a coordinator did not ask for.

## Pins survive by construction, not by a check

A pinned slot is excluded from the removal set, so it is still there when the
solver counts what is already placed, and the solver works around it exactly
as it works around every other placed lesson. There is no "respect the pins"
branch that a later edit could forget.

Proved from the database: pin a lesson, recalculate the very scope it sits
in, and the row comes back with the same id, the same day and the same
period.

## Two things needed the solver to join a transaction

`solve()` gained an optional `client`. Without it neither §8 nor §17 is
possible:

**Atomicity.** The removal and the re-solve are one transaction. Committing
the removal on one connection and then failing the placement on another
leaves a school with lessons deleted and nothing put back — the worst
available outcome for a screen whose whole purpose is a safe small change.

**Preview.** It is the same transaction, rolled back: the real solver, the
real GiST constraints, the real result, then `ROLLBACK`. Computing a preview
any other way would be a second implementation of the thing being previewed,
and would differ from it on exactly the cases that matter.

Every existing caller omits the parameter and behaves as it always did.

## Measured, because §13 says not to claim it otherwise

Same schools as the P9-3 benchmark. The scope is ONE TEACHER — the brief's
own example, and the smallest useful unit; a section scope would flatter the
numbers on a large school.

| profile | sections | slots | full generation | scoped p50 | affected | share | speed-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| small | 20 | 560 | 1,329 ms | 138 ms | 27 | 4.8% | **9.6×** |
| medium | 40 | 1,125 | 2,287 ms | 241 ms | 29 | 2.6% | **9.5×** |
| large (2 shifts) | 80 | 2,319 | 4,721 ms | 220 ms | 29 | 1.3% | **21.5×** |
| college (2 shifts) | 120 | 3,479 | 7,684 ms | 160 ms | 30 | 0.9% | **48×** |

The gain grows with the school, which is the shape that matters: a teacher's
timetable is roughly constant while the institution is not, so the share of
the week touched falls from 4.8% to 0.9% and the work falls with it.

## One undo for one instruction

§18 is explicit that a scoped re-solve must not leave dozens of entries.
Migration 075 widens `routine_edit_log.action` to admit `resolve`, and the
inverse names every slot to restore and every slot to remove. Order matters
inside it: the placements go out FIRST, because restoring the originals into
hours the re-solve filled would collide with the very rows about to be taken
out.

## Concurrency is a fingerprint, and it is called one

`routines` has no row version and `routine_slots.row_version` is per slot, so
a re-solve needs a whole-routine answer to "has this changed since you
looked?". `count(*) || ':' || sum(row_version)` moves when a slot is added,
removed or edited. Two changes that cancelled exactly could in principle
agree, which is why it is documented as a fingerprint rather than a
guarantee — the exclusion constraints remain the thing that cannot be fooled.

Checked INSIDE the transaction, so the answer cannot go stale between the
check and the work.

## Bangla needed a genitive

The undo label read "রফিক স্যার ক্লাসগুলো আবার হিসাব", which is not a
sentence — Bangla marks the possessive and a reader notices its absence the
way an English reader notices "Rahim classes". `possessiveBn` applies the
ordinary rule: a vowel ending takes র, a consonant takes ের. A section or
room LABEL does not take it, because "নবম-কের" reads as nonsense; the noun
after it carries the relationship instead.

## Two things the browser and the probe found

**The benchmark named rooms after capability codes.** `computer_lab ২`
appeared in the editor grid — and the grid was right, because it shows a
school's OWN room name and P9-4 deliberately does not scrub those. The
fixture was manufacturing a false positive for the exact defect P9-4 spent a
section eliminating. Rooms are now named like rooms.

**The migration probe could not fail.** 075 CHANGES an existing constraint
rather than adding one, and the name is identical before and after — so a
rolled-back 075 was reported as applied. Found by running the rollback and
watching the probe say "fully migrated". `migration-status.mjs` gained a
`constraint_def` kind that matches the definition text.

## Evidence

- **1964 tests, all passing** across 13 workspaces — 16 new API
  (`resolve.test.ts`, including the two-shift regression), 10 new view, 3 new
  presentation
- 26/26 SQL suites run **three times**; the resolve and editor suites three
  times
- typecheck 0/0/0 · build clean · **75/75 migrations**, and 075 proved
  down → **detected as MISSING** → up
- **Security probe 29/29** against a running deployment (`local-docker-p9-6`)
- **Browser, real API, a generated 20-section school:** pin a lesson →
  "আবার হিসাব করুন" → apply is DISABLED → preview → "প্রভাবিত ক্লাস: ২৯টি ·
  অপরিবর্তিত থাকবে: ৫৩২টি · পিন করা — অক্ষত: ১টি · কোথাও বসানো যায়নি: ০টি"
  with "এখনো কিছুই বদলানো হয়নি" — and **the grid did not change during the
  preview** → apply → 28 cells marked, the pinned one untouched, ONE undo
  entry reading "সপ্তম-খ শাখার রুটিন আবার হিসাব" → undo → the routine returns
- **Tenant isolation, live:** school B holding A's routine and section ids
  gets 404 on resolve, on a day scope and on preview; A's slots and A's undo
  stack are unchanged
- **Nine widths 360–1600 and a real 375px viewport**: the drawer is exactly
  375 wide with no overflow and no horizontal body scroll (the earlier
  reading was an artifact of forcing `body.width` while a fixed-position
  dialog sized itself to the real viewport)
- **Both themes**: dialog `#FFFFFF` / `#241E1A`, text `#53443D` / `#EDE7DA`
- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`

## Honest limits

**Four scopes, not a predicate.** Teacher, section, room, day. Each maps to a
question a school actually asks and each resolves to a set the solver can put
back; §2 says not to expose an option the solver cannot guarantee, and a
free-form filter would be one.

**"Unchanged" counts the whole routine, not the scope.** In the browser run,
29 affected and 532 unchanged out of 560 — 28 non-pinned rows were replaced
and one pinned row kept its id. The numbers add up but they answer two
different questions, and the labels are what keep them apart.

**A re-solve that changes nothing still replaces rows.** The solver is
deterministic, so re-solving the same gaps produces the same week — but with
new slot ids, which is why the summary pairs before and after on (section,
subject) rather than on id. A coordinator sees "কিছুই বদলানোর দরকার হয়নি";
the database sees new rows.

**Preview costs what apply costs.** It runs the real solver. That is
affordable precisely because the scope is small, and it would not be for a
whole-school re-solve — which is what `POST /rms/generate` is for.

**Availability changes are not detected automatically.** A coordinator who
marks a teacher unavailable must then ask for that teacher's scope to be
recalculated. Wiring the change itself to offer it is a P9-7-or-later
convenience, and inventing it here would have meant guessing which of eleven
inputs should trigger what.

# P9-7 — the review nobody could read, and the state nobody could write (2026-09-07)

## What §1 asked for, and what was actually there

The brief says to execute `POST /api/v1/academics/publish` against the real
database rather than trusting that it typechecks. Executed:

```
POST /academics/publish { examId: <a routine id> }  →  404 exam_not_found
```

That endpoint publishes **exam results**. The routine publish was
`POST /rms/editor { action: 'publish' }` — a button in the editor that
published whatever was on screen without ever saying what that was. Both are
now exercised; the distinction is OBSERVED rather than inferred from a header
comment.

## The status the schema had carried since migration 006

`routine_status` is `draft | review | active | superseded | archived`.
Nothing in the product had ever written `review`.

That is the fourth time this shape has turned up in P9 — after
`section_subject_teachers` (P9-1), the bell schedule (P9-2) and `is_pinned`
(P9-5): **a control that exists, is enforced, and that nothing can reach.**

It matters because publishing is not one person's act in a Bangladeshi
school. A coordinator builds the timetable; the head decides it is the
school's. Without `review` the coordinator's only two options are "still
mine" and "live to three thousand guardians".

`submit` is deliberately NOT gated on the routine being clean. A coordinator
who has done what they can with a timetable that still has a conflict needs
to hand it over and say so; refusing the handover would leave the two of them
with no way to discuss it inside the product. Publishing is where the
conflict blocks, and that is the right place — it is the point at which the
school's day would actually become wrong.

Proved from the database: a routine in review propagates `review` to all 560
slots, and `app.student_day` returns **0 rows**.

## One gate, two callers

`src/publish-gate.ts` decides what blocks and what merely warns.
`api/publish.ts`'s GET renders its answer; `publishRoutine` enforces it. A
second copy of these rules is the defect the file exists to prevent — P9-4
found that exact shape twice, in two readers of the same routines disagreeing
about hard conflicts. There is a test whose only job is that the two never
disagree.

The explicit gate does not replace the exclusion constraints, and the
constraint handling is still there. The gate READS; the constraints hold
under concurrency. Between the count and the UPDATE another editor can place
the very slot that collides, and that race is what the database is for. What
the gate changes is WHO the coordinator hears it from: a number on the review
screen while there is still something to do, instead of a 409 after pressing
the button.

## §4 — the refusal the earlier probe could not exercise

The first probe tried to plant a conflict by duplicating a lesson into
another SECTION at the same hour. Every section was busy, and
`rs_no_section_double_booking` applies to drafts anyway, so that route could
never have worked. It reported `plantedConflict: 0` and a `200` that was
actually the legitimate publish — which is why it was recorded as NOT
exercised rather than as a pass.

A **teacher** double-booking is the one a draft can hold:
`rs_no_teacher_double_booking` is `WHERE status='active' AND
routine_status='active'`, and a draft's slots are `routine_status='draft'`.
Give two lessons at the same hour the same teacher and the state exists.

Now proved, with the conflict confirmed at DB level by a query independent of
the endpoint, so the test cannot pass by the gate being wired to a constant:

## §5 — a warning is a decision, so it is made once and recorded

Warnings do not block. That is the existing contract, not a new one: §8.1
marks gaps and permits publishing over them, because a school routinely
publishes a timetable with a known hole while it hires. Turning that into a
blocker would stop schools using the product for a situation the product
exists to survive.

But publishing over one is a decision, so the server refuses an unconfirmed
publish and hands back what it wanted confirmed — the second attempt, with
`confirmWarnings`, is the person's answer rather than a retry. The accepted
warnings then travel with the success AND into the audit row, because a
school asking six months later why the timetable had a hole should get "it
was visible and accepted", not a bare status change.

## A count that could not be anything but zero

`publish()` had returned an `unfilled` count since §8.1 — teaching slots with
no teacher — and the editor rendered it: "প্রকাশিত হয়েছে — তবে ১টি ঘর এখনো
খালি।"

`routine_slots` has carried this since migration 006:

```sql
CHECK (slot_kind <> 'teaching'
       OR (primary_section_id IS NOT NULL AND subject_id IS NOT NULL
           AND teacher_id IS NOT NULL))
```

So the set is empty by construction. The number was a tautology reported as a
measurement, the sentence could only ever say "০টি", and the **only** place
it had ever said otherwise was `demo.ts`, which hard-coded `unfilled: 1` —
manufacturing the state the schema forbids.

Found by writing a test that tried to create the state and being refused by
the database. Removed rather than tested around: the gap a school actually
has is a DEMAND the solver could not place, which the solver already reports
and the review already warns about.

## The sentences are the server's

The first version of the confirmation composed its paragraph in the browser
out of `slots`, `supersedes.version` and the warnings. P9-3's generate screen
states the rule that breaks: *"the verdict is rendered, never composed here —
a browser that assembled its own sentence from the counters would drift from
the numbers beside it the first time either changed."*

The same rule applies with more force to the only irreversible button in the
workstream, so `consequenceBn` and `verdictBn` are composed in
`api/publish.ts`. It also takes a paragraph of Bangla off a 2G phone's
critical path, where every byte is budgeted.

## What the browser found

**A live routine was described as broken.** Immediately after a successful
publish the card showed "যা ঠিক করতে হবে — এই রুটিন আগেই প্রকাশিত।" That
blocker exists so the endpoint refuses a *second* publish; rendered under
"what must be fixed" it told a head their working timetable needed repair.
Blockers are no longer drawn for a published routine. The warnings stay —
what the routine carries is still worth reading after it goes live.

**Every timestamp printed an em-dash.** `max(updated_at)::text` gives
`2026-09-07 04:38:43.975379+00`; a **two-digit** offset is not valid ISO and
Chrome's `new Date()` refuses it. The API now emits real ISO 8601.

**A Latin meridiem in a Bangla sentence.** `Intl.DateTimeFormat('bn-BD')`
produced "৭ সেপ্টেম্বর, ২০২৬ এ ১০:৩৮ AM". Replaced with the product's own
`formatDayMonth` + `formatTime`, which write the 24-hour clock Bangla uses —
the same class of leak P9-4 spent a section removing.

**A dari before a clause.** "এই রুটিন চালু আছে। — ৭ সেপ্টেম্বর" closes the
sentence and then continues it.

## Evidence

- **2004 tests, all passing** across 13 workspaces — 22 new API
  (`publish.test.ts`), 18 new view (`routine-publish-view.test.ts`), 1 new
  service-worker assertion
- 26/26 SQL suites run **three times**; the four routine API suites three
  times (71/71 each)
- typecheck 0/0/0 · **75/75 migrations, and P9-7 needed none** — the enum
  already had `review` and `audit.activity_log.action` has no DB constraint
- **Security probe 29/29** against the running deployment
- **D11 brand boundary**: tenant surfaces clean, all three platform surfaces
  branded
- **Browser, real API, a generated 20-section school:** draft → "পর্যালোচনার
  জন্য পাঠান" → badge "পর্যালোচনায়" with "এখনো কেউ এটি দেখতে পাচ্ছে না" →
  "প্রকাশ করুন" → a confirmation naming 560 lessons, who will see them, and
  both accepted warnings, focus on বাতিল → published, "প্রকাশ করেছেন প্রধান
  শিক্ষক", every lifecycle button gone
- A second draft beside it reads "প্রকাশ করলে এখনকার চালু রুটিনটি (নম্বর ১)
  বাতিল হবে"
- **375px**: no horizontal overflow, dialog exactly 375 wide,
  `role="alertdialog"`, focus on বাতিল
- **Both themes**: dialog `#FFFFFF` / `#241E1A`, text `#53443D` / `#EDE7DA`
- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`

## Honest limits

**Publishing is online only, and the screen says so.** It cannot be queued:
whether a routine may go live depends on every other routine in the school at
that instant, so two offline devices could queue two publications that are
each valid alone and together are not. Offline the action is disabled with
that reason in a sentence — not hidden, because a coordinator who cannot find
the button concludes the feature is broken. The review itself still reads.

**The fingerprint tracks application edits, not raw SQL.**
`routine_slots.row_version` is bumped by the editor's writes, not by a
trigger, so a change made directly in the database does not move it. That is
the concurrency case it exists for — two coordinators in the editor — and it
was already documented in P9-6 as a fingerprint rather than a guarantee.

**"সর্বশেষ পরিবর্তন" moves when the status does.**
`trg_routines_propagate_status` touches every slot on a status change, so
submitting for review updates the timestamp. The rows genuinely changed; it
just is not the edit a head has in mind when they read the label.

**A replacement draft generated while one is live is mostly empty.**
OBSERVED: v1 published with 560 slots, then a fresh generation placed **193**,
with 125 of 129 unplaced demands reading `no_free_slot`. The live routine's
slots are `routine_status='active'`, so the year-scoped teacher and room
exclusions bind them and the new draft cannot use those hours. P9-7 did not
cause this — it made it visible, because publishing is now reachable.
Recorded as **B-108**; fixing it means teaching `generate` to treat the
routine being replaced as not-a-constraint, which is a solver-input change
and belongs to whichever phase owns re-generation.

## The budget said no, and it was right (B-109)

Adding the screen put `app.js` **401 bytes over** the 180 KB gzipped
critical-path budget, which fails CI. HEAD had 1,738 bytes of headroom and a
screen costs about 2,000 — so the *next* screen would have failed too,
whatever it contained. The new view is 9.3 kB minified, the smallest of the
routine screens and smaller than `rooms-view.ts`; there was no fat in it.

The cause was `demo.ts`: **94.1 kB minified, 10.7% of the bundle**, larger
than the next four views combined, downloaded by every school on a 2G
connection so they could not open it.

`platform.js` had already set the precedent — a separate bundle "so a school's
device never downloads the console's code". The demo is the same argument with
a bigger number, and `DemoAuth` is constructed at exactly ONE seam inside an
already-`async` `main()`. `app.ts` now holds an `import type` (erased at
compile time) plus `await import('/demo.js')`, and the app build marks
`/demo.js` **external** so esbuild leaves the import for the browser rather
than inlining the module back into the bundle the split exists to shrink.

**app.js: 184,721 → 159,352 bytes gzipped. 24,968 of headroom, against the
same limit.**

Verified in the browser, not inferred: a production `/app` load's resource
list is `/app.css`, `/app.js` and its API calls — **no `/demo.js`**. `?demo=1`
fetches it, and all six roles work on both demo tenants.

`/demo.js` joins `UNHASHED_ENTRY_ASSETS` rather than being left to
`IMMUTABLE`, which matches on the `.js` extension and would have pinned a
visitor to the first demo build their browser ever downloaded — the
`/platform.js` defect the file already documents, in a second place. It is
deliberately NOT precached: the demo is an online shopfront, and precaching it
would put the 94 kB back on every device by another route.

Two things the split itself exposed. The demo's review payload hard-coded one
school's name, so tenant B's screen showed tenant A's — the demo carries two
institutions precisely so that is visible. And a refused ACTION was calling
`refuseUnlessOk`, which throws into the permission panel: the demo's
"this build does not write" 403 wiped the review it had just drawn and told a
head they were not allowed to see their own timetable. A refused action is now
a notice; the denial panel stays for a refused READ, where it is the truth.

# B-108 — the second timetable a school could never have (2026-09-07)

## Root cause: one word in a comment that stopped being true

`RmsSolver.loadExistingSlots` gathered "this routine's own slots, PLUS every
slot in any other ACTIVE routine for the same year — **which is the other
shift**".

That last clause was true while the only way to have two active routines was
to run two shifts. It stopped being true the moment a school published and
then regenerated: the second active routine is the SAME shift's predecessor,
and the solver counted every teacher and every room it holds as taken — by
the timetable the new draft exists to replace.

Measured on a real 20-section school: **560 placed in v1, 193 in v2**, with
**125 of 129** unplaced demands reading `no_free_slot`.

**The database was never involved.** The teacher and room exclusions are
predicated on `routine_status = 'active'`, and their own comment says so:
*"Only ACTIVE routines participate, so a draft may still overlap the routine
it will replace."* Proved rather than trusted — an INSERT of a draft slot
holding the same teacher AND the same room at the same hour as a published
slot is accepted, and there is a test whose passing IS that insert not
raising.

The fix is a predicate, not an algorithm change:

```sql
AND (rs.routine_id = $1
     OR rs.routine_id = ANY($3::uuid[])
     OR (rs.routine_status = 'active' AND r.shift <> $4::shift_code))
```

Derived from the schema rather than passed in by a caller. `uq_routine_active`
allows at most one active routine per (tenant, year, shift), so "the active
routine for MY shift" names the predecessor uniquely and cannot name the
wrong one — and a caller who passed nothing would have had the solver ignore
the other shift too, which is the failure this same query was written to fix
in P9-3.

## The second half: the replacement could not be published at all

Even filled, v2 could not go live. `uq_routine_active` raised 23505 and the
endpoint answered *"একটি রুটিন ইতিমধ্যে চালু আছে — আগে সেটি বদলান"* — change it
first, with nothing that could.

`routines.supersedes_id` and the `superseded` status have both existed since
migration 006. The live database held **0 of each**. Nothing in the product
had ever written either.

That is the **fifth** control this workstream has found in that state, after
`section_subject_teachers` (P9-1), the bell schedule (P9-2), `is_pinned`
(P9-5) and `review` (P9-7). The sixth is below.

Publishing now demotes then promotes, in the caller's transaction. The order
is forced by the index — two active rows for one (year, shift) cannot exist
even for the length of a statement — and one transaction is what stops a
failure between them leaving a school with **no** live timetable, which is
strictly worse than the old one it was replacing.

## Replacement semantics: both, because they answer different questions

`routines.generated_by` has admitted `'copied'` alongside `'solver'` since
migration 006, and nothing had ever written that either.

**`baseline: 'inputs'`** — the default, and exactly what `/rms/generate` has
always done. A fresh draft the solver fills from current academic demand.
Right when the INPUTS changed: three teachers left, a subject's periods went
up. Pins are not carried, because a pin refers to a placement in a timetable
this one is not derived from.

**`baseline: 'current'`** — the live routine copied into a new draft, pins and
all, which the same solver then tops up. Right when the school wants this
timetable with three changes — and that is what a replacement usually is. It
is also the only route by which a published routine can be edited, since
publishing makes it immutable.

Neither is a second generation system. The clone is one `INSERT ... SELECT`
and then stops; every placement decision after that is `RmsSolver`, unchanged.

Cloning is REFUSED when the bell schedule has changed underneath it. A copied
slot points at a `period_definition_id`; on a new template those ids belong to
the old one, and the copy would look right while placing every lesson at the
previous timetable's clock times.

## Pins (§5)

Carried by the clone, as pins, verified by comparing (day, period, teacher,
section, subject) before and after. That is what a pin means — a
coordinator's decision about where a lesson goes — and one that survived one
version and not the next would be worthless. From that moment P9-6's guarantee
takes over: pins are excluded from a scoped re-solve's removal set, so they
survive by construction rather than by a check.

## Measured (§11)

Same schools as every previous P9 benchmark. Wall clock around the real
handler; local container, no network, no TLS, no render.

| profile | sections | initial | replace-new | replace-copy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| small | 20 | 1,124 ms · 560/580 | 1,128 ms · 560/580 | **151 ms** · 560/580 |
| medium | 40 | 2,119 ms · 1125/1160 | 2,163 ms · 1125/1160 | **217 ms** · 1125/1160 |
| large (2 shifts) | 80 | 4,414 ms · 2325/2360 | 4,449 ms · 2325/2360 | **438 ms** · 2325/2360 |
| college (2 shifts) | 120 | 6,702 ms · 3464/3600 | 6,698 ms · 3464/3600 | **608 ms** · 3464/3600 |

The number that matters is not the time — it is that **replace-new now places
exactly what initial places**, at every size. That column was the defect.

The clone is 7.4× to 11× faster because the solver meets a routine that is
already full and has almost nothing to place; a copy is work the database
does in one statement rather than work the solver does per lesson.

## §16 — the numerals, and the sixth unreachable control

`--font-bn-num` has existed in `app.css` with its reason written beside it —
*"Hind Siliguri's Bangla digits are ambiguous … Letters stay on Hind
Siliguri"* — and `grep -c 'var(--font-bn-num)'` over the whole stylesheet
returned **0**.

The screenshot complaint was exactly right and worse than cosmetic. In Hind
Siliguri at UI sizes **১ is close enough to ৮** that:

- `১০টি` reads as `৮০টি`
- `১০:৪৫` reads as `৮০:৪৫`
- `১২,৫০০.৭৫` reads as `৮২,৫০০.৭৫`

A count, a class time and a fee, each wrong by a digit.

**A token could never have fixed it.** `font-family` reaches whole elements,
and digits do not arrive as elements — they arrive inside sentences. The split
has to happen per CHARACTER, which is what `unicode-range` is for and the only
mechanism in CSS that can do it. Wrapping every number in a span would mean
touching every string in the product and still missing the next one written.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'ShikhonBnNum';
  src: local('Noto Sans Bengali'), … local('Nirmala UI'), local('Kohinoor Bangla') …;
  unicode-range: U+09E6-09EF;
}
```

Named FIRST in `--font-body`, `--font-bn` and `--font-heading`.

**Measured, not assumed, and it changed the fix:** `local('Noto Sans Bengali')`
does **not** match on Windows at all. What a Windows browser actually falls
back to is **Nirmala UI** — the earlier reading that "Noto is available" was
Windows substituting it. A Noto-only list, which is what the token named,
would have fixed the target Android device and left every desk unfixed. Each
platform's own Bangla face is now named.

Verified in a real browser at 32px:

| | digits `০১২৩৪৫৬৭৮৯` | letters `বিদ্যালয়` |
|---|---|---|
| Hind Siliguri only | 186.76 px | 101.67 px |
| shipped stack | **218.41 px** | **101.67 px** |

The digits moved face; the letters did not. That is the requirement, and it is
the whole requirement — the UI has not been switched away from Hind Siliguri.

`local()` only, so it downloads nothing: `app.css`'s own header rules out
self-hosted webfonts after one 404'd and broke the service-worker install, and
the precache list already states that Bangla renders from the device's own
font. Where no face matches, the digit falls through to Hind Siliguri and the
screen is exactly what it is today — the worst case of this rule is no change.

All nine cases §16 lists were rendered and read: single, two and three digits,
every digit, time, date, money, percentage, and a digit inside a Bangla
sentence.

## What the browser found

**A superseded routine offered "প্রকাশ করুন" and "সম্পাদনা করুন".** B-108
created a fourth state on the review screen, and the guard was written
`!published` when only draft and active existed. One button would have 409'd
and the other opens an editor that refuses every write. The retired card also
carried "যা ঠিক করতে হবে — এই রুটিন আগেই প্রকাশিত", which is the same defect
P9-7 fixed for the published card, in the state that did not exist yet.

**A cached payload could kill the publish button.** `[...e.consequenceBn]`
throws on undefined inside a click handler, which loses the dialog and leaves
the button dead with nothing on screen to say why. A service worker holding a
response from before the server composed those sentences is enough.

**The demo showed one school's name on the other's screen.** The publish
fixture hard-coded it; the demo carries two institutions precisely so that is
visible.

## Evidence

- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`

## Honest limits

**The browser leg covered principal and teacher; student and guardian are
covered by the API suite.** The benchmark school seeds neither, so the
four-role check for those two is `replacement.test.ts` §14 against real
student and guardian users — 403 on create and on publish, with the live
routine unchanged — rather than a screenshot.

**A retired version is not shown anywhere yet.** Superseded routines are
excluded from the publish screen deliberately: a school accumulates one every
revision, and this is the screen a head publishes FROM. What replaced what is
on the audit record (`rms.routine.publish` carries `supersededId` and
`supersededVersion`). A history screen is not built.

**`generated_by` holds one value for a routine that was both copied and
solved.** 'copied' wins, because it is the fact a reader cannot recover
elsewhere — `solver_run_id` and `solver_seconds` already record that the
solver ran.

**The numeral face cannot be verified on Android from here.** It is measured
working on Windows via Nirmala UI, and the Noto names are the ones Android
uses; a device without any named face falls through to today's rendering, so
the change cannot regress. Confirming the Android rendering needs an Android
device.

**Nothing carries a pin from a fresh generation.** Choosing 'inputs' over a
live routine discards its pins, and the screen says so before the button is
pressed. Carrying them into a draft not derived from that timetable would
place lessons a coordinator never asked for into a week they have not seen.

---

# P9-8 — eight audiences, one routine (2026-09-07)

## The whole design is a WHERE clause

A school's timetable exists once: the routine whose `status = 'active'`. The
institution's view, a class's, a group's, a stream's, a section's, a teacher's,
a room's and a student's are eight selections from it — one endpoint, one
query, one response shape.

`GET /api/v1/rms/timetable?scope=…&id=…`

The alternative — a per-role endpoint, or a table per audience — is how a
school ends up with a teacher and a student reading different timetables for
the same hour. There is a test whose only job is that every scope's lessons
are a subset of the institution's.

## `status = 'active'` is the whole visibility rule

Applied once, in the read every scope passes through. A draft belongs to the
coordinator building it (P9-5/P9-6) and to the head reviewing it (P9-7); it is
not a timetable until somebody publishes it. B-108's `superseded` is excluded
by the same clause **without being named**, which is why a new lifecycle state
cannot become readable by accident.

Proved with a generated-but-unpublished routine: the principal, the teacher,
the student and the guardian all see `published: false` and zero lessons, and
all four see it the moment it is published.

## Authorisation is per SCOPE, and asks the database

A single `requireRole` on the handler would be wrong in both directions — it
would either let a student ask for the institution or stop a teacher reading
their own week. So each scope states who may ask for it, and the subject-level
ones use the functions the RLS policies themselves use:

  `app.my_section_ids()`   — the sections a teacher teaches, including
                             `section_subject_teachers` and not only class
                             teaching
  `app.my_ward_ids()`      — a guardian's children
  `app.can_see_student()`  — the same gate `app.student_day` is joined to

| scope | principal · owner · coordinator · IT | teacher | student | guardian |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| institution, class, group, stream, room | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| teacher | any | own only | ✗ | ✗ |
| section | any | ones they teach | own | ward's |
| student | any | of their sections | own | ward's |

Every one of those rows is a separate assertion, positive and negative.

## The picker is the server's list

`offered` comes back with the scopes this caller may actually ask for, built
from the same role list and the same helpers the filters use. A menu assembled
in the browser from `auth.role` would be a second opinion about permission,
and the first time the two disagreed a person would be offered a view that
403s. There is a test that walks every offered scope and asserts the server
answers it — the drift, caught rather than assumed.

An omitted `scope` is answered from that same menu rather than from a default.
A default is a second opinion too: the day somebody widens a role list, a
default becomes a leak.

## A student sees the half of a split hour they attend

A parallel block is an hour where the section divides by religion or optional
subject. The student scope filters through `student_subjects`, exactly as
`app.student_day` does — showing all of them would put a class on a child's
timetable they do not attend. The SECTION's grid keeps the whole block, marked
"বিভাজিত ক্লাস", because a coordinator has to see both halves.

## What the browser found

**The response was shipping its own SQL.** The first version spread the filter
object into the body, so `where` (the predicate) and `params` (a bound section
or student uuid) went to the browser. Found by reading a real response, fixed
to send only the two presentation fields, and pinned by a test.

**The section count was counted on labels.** Every class has a section named
'ক', so de-duplicating the rendered labels told a head their twenty-section
school had four. The counts now come from the server, on ids —
`count(DISTINCT primary_section_id)`.

**The demo answered with the page's role, not the caller's.** The case
constructed a fresh `DemoAuth`, which re-reads `location.search`, so every
persona got whichever role the URL named.

**A teacher asking about a teacher got 404 where a room got 403.** The
existence check ran before the permission check, and `users_scope` hides the
row — so the two refusals differed, and the difference is itself information.
Permission is decided first now; 404 is reserved for a caller who MAY ask
about somebody who is not there.

## Numerals (§16)

B-108's `ShikhonBnNum` face already routes every ০-৯ in the product through
`unicode-range: U+09E6-09EF`, including the digits inside sentences that no
class selector can reach. Verified on this screen: digits move face
(186.76 → 218.41 px at 32px) while letters do not (101.67 → 101.67 px).

`--font-bn-num` is applied where the element's whole content is a figure — the
grid's period number and its clock time. The clock time got its own class
rather than reusing `.routine-slot-meta`, which also carries teacher and room
NAMES: the token names Noto first for the whole element, and on a mixed
element it would drag the letters along too.

Read on screen: `১`, `২`, `৩`, `১০`, `২৩ জন`, `৫৬০টি`, `১০:০০–১০:৪৫`,
`৭ সেপ্টেম্বর ২০২৬`, `সংস্করণ ২`, `২২টি`.

The one Latin numeral on the screen is `academic_years.label` — "2026" as the
benchmark fixture typed it. That is the school's own free-text label, supplied
by whoever provisioned the year, and it is not converted for the same reason
P9-4 does not scrub a school's room names: a school that labels its year
"2026-27" would be mangled by a blind digit conversion.

  the institution reads ৫৬০টি ক্লাস · ২০টি শাখা · ২৩ জন শিক্ষক · ২২টি কক্ষ;
  switching to কক্ষ ও ল্যাব re-reads and draws that room's week
- **Browser, demo, five personas:** a student and a guardian see one section
  and get no picker at all; a class teacher is offered আমার রুটিন and আমার

- **Nine widths** 360 · 375 · 390 · 640 · 768 · 1024 · 1280 · 1440 · 1600:
  `document.body.scrollWidth` never exceeds the viewport, and the grid scrolls
  inside `.table-scroll` rather than pushing the page
- **Both themes**: card `#FFFFFF` / `#241E1A`, cell `#E9E3D4` / `#302821`,
  text `#53443D` / `#EDE7DA`
- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`

## Honest limits

**This screen is the published WEEK, not today.** Day-level substitutions —
who is covering for an absent teacher on Tuesday — live in the existing
`/rms/routine` and `/academics/myroutine` day views, which read
`app.teacher_day` and `app.student_day` and merge substitutions for a date.
Merging them here would make a weekly grid that changes meaning depending on
which week you are in.

**The institution's grid caps a cell at three lessons.** A whole school's
Sunday first period holds twenty; printing them all makes a list, not a grid.
The rest are counted ("আরও ১৭টি") and the way to see them is to narrow the
scope, which is what the picker is for.

**Group and stream are one dropdown each, from the classes that exist.** A
school with one group sees one option. That is honest — it is what the school
has — but it means the group scope looks pointless until a college with
science and humanities opens it.

**Nothing here is printable yet.** The brief's outputs are screens; a printed
class routine on a noticeboard is what a Bangladeshi school actually pins up,
and `packages/ui-core/src/documents.ts` is where that would live. Recorded as
B-112.

**The year label can be Latin.** See above — it is the school's own text.

# P9-9 — the routine as paper (2026-09-07)

## Almost all of it already existed

§1 said to inspect `packages/ui-core/src/documents.ts` before implementing,
and that inspection is most of this phase's design. R-5 had already built:

- one builder per document returning `{ title, meta, bodyHtml }`, pure, no DOM
- `brandedDocument()` / `brandedDocumentSet()` wrapping any of them in the
  tenant's letterhead, watermark and signature
- `@page{size:A4}`, `page-break-inside:avoid` on table rows,
  `display:table-header-group` on `thead`, `orphans:3; widows:3`
- an endpoint, `GET /api/v1/ops/document`, whose header says "The tenant is
  never a parameter" — branding comes from the JWT, so a Tenant A user cannot
  render on Tenant B's letterhead, not because a check rejects it but because
  the request cannot express it
- a preview that IS the print: a sandboxed `srcdoc` iframe and
  `contentWindow.print()`

So P9-9 is a **seventh document type**, not a print system. No PDF library, no
renderer, no second pipeline — §13 asked for exactly that restraint and the
architecture already had it.

## Where the routine sheet lives, and why it is not in rms-svc

`document.ts` carries a comment from B-53 — "the machinery is not the content"
— and a `CONTENT_SERVICE` map gating each document on the service that owns its
data. That settles the placement: the printing machinery is shared, so the
routine sheet belongs to the document endpoint like the other six.

But the AUTHORISATION belongs to P9-8. So `document.ts` imports
`readTimetable` from `rms-svc` rather than re-deriving who may see what. One
authorisation path, one data read; a printed sheet cannot show an hour the
screen would refuse. (`platform-svc` already imports `academics-svc/src` for
the same reason.)

`CONTENT_SERVICE` maps `routine_sheet` to **nothing**, like `id_card` and
`transfer_certificate`: there is no `routine` row in `service_catalogue`
because the timetable is not a switchable module — it is what the school IS.
A school with finance turned off still runs classes and still pins up a
routine.

## §15 is true by construction

`readTimetable` reads `routines.status = 'active'` and nothing else, so draft,
review and B-108's `superseded` are invisible to the print path without a
single check in it. Asserted rather than assumed: a generated-but-unpublished
routine answers **409 `not_published`** to the principal, the teacher and the
student alike, and prints the moment it is published. Publishing a replacement
moves the sheet to v2 in the same breath.

The drawer says the rule out loud — "শুধু প্রকাশিত রুটিন ছাপা যায়" — rather
than leaving somebody to wonder why the draft they just edited is missing.

## §3 — paper follows content, and §7 forced the real design

Portrait for a section, a teacher, a room and a student: one lesson per hour,
six columns, 182mm of usable width, ~30mm a column.

Landscape for an institution, a class, a group or a stream: their cells stack
every section running at that hour, and at 30mm those wrap into slivers.

That was the easy half. The hard half was measured, not reasoned:

| school | classes | grouping by class gives | outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20 sections | 5 | 4 lessons per cell | 5 pages, one per class ✓ |
| 120-section college | **4** | **30 lessons per cell** | a row taller than the sheet ✗ |

A college has FEW classes and MANY sections each, so a class-per-page booklet
does not bound anything. `page-break-inside: avoid` cannot rescue a row that
does not fit a page at all — it simply overflows.

So the rule is on DEPTH, not on scope: **pages split until no cell holds more
than six lessons.** A class fits one page where it can; where it cannot, it
splits again into one page per section. Measured after the change:

    120 sections → 120 pages, worst cell 1, 100 ms, 521 kB
     20 sections →   5 pages, worst cell 4,  52 ms,  58 kB

120 single-section sheets is also what a college's office actually prints —
one for each classroom door. §7 asked for multiple clean pages over shrunken
text, and this is that, with a number behind it.

## §5 — the ordinals needed a table

`format.ts` already warned, in its own comment, that Bangla ordinals are
per-number and that appending "ম" gives "১১ম" where a school says "একাদশ" —
and that **P4 shipped exactly that mistake once, as "২ম পিরিয়ড"**.

The brief's own examples (`১ম`, `২য়`) are the short forms, which need the same
treatment for the same reason: ২য়, ৩য়, ৪র্থ and ৬ষ্ঠ each differ. `ordinalBn`
is that table, beside `levelNameBn` so there is one of each, falling back to
the plain numeral past it rather than guessing a suffix.

The period column and the clock time carry `--font-bn-num`; the lesson cells
beside them keep Hind Siliguri for the names in them. B-108's `unicode-range`
face covers everything else.

## §4 — an unbranded school was printing a placeholder

`parseBranding({})` falls back to the neutral "শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠান", and that
default is deliberate and documented: a tenant whose branding is unset should
look unbranded rather than look like a different institution.

But `tenants.name_bn` is given when the school is created and is never
optional. A school that has simply never opened the branding screen still HAS
a name, and printing a placeholder on its routine — and on its receipts, its
report cards and its transfer certificates — was losing the one identifying
fact §4 requires every document to carry.

The branding load now starts from the tenant's own name and lets the branding
JSON override it, so a school that brands itself differently keeps that. This
fixes all seven documents, not just the new one.

## §19 — what the print acceptance could and could not do

**Could not:** capture a real print/PDF. `window.print()` opens a blocking
OS-level dialog; invoking it wedged the renderer and the tab had to be
discarded. §19 allows for this ("if the environment permits") and it does not.

**Could, and did:** measure the RENDERED document rather than read its CSS.

- The page box, from computed style inside the preview iframe:
  **297mm × 210mm** for a landscape booklet, matching A4 exactly.
- `break-before: page` computed on the second page onward — pages really do
  start fresh.
- The `@media print` rules re-scoped to `screen` in a throwaway iframe and
  then measured, which tests that the rules THIS document ships resolve to the
  values §6 requires:

  | property | computed |
  |---|---|
  | `.rt-grid tr` break-inside | `avoid` — no row split across pages |
  | `.rt-lesson` break-inside | `avoid` — no lesson cut in half |
  | `.rt-grid thead` display | `table-header-group` — header repeats |
  | `.rt-grid tbody` break-inside | `auto` — the grid flows |
  | `.doc` margin | `0px` — the `@page` margin owns the edge |
  | horizontal overflow | none |

That is the difference between "the CSS says so" and "the browser computed
so". What remains unverified is only the final rasterisation, which needs a
print capture this environment cannot produce.

## §16 — the strongest possible answer

`/api/v1/ops/document` routes **network-only with no cache at all**, so there
is nothing stored that could be served to the next tenant. Above that, the
tenant is never a parameter: it comes from the JWT. A→B→A alternating requests
each answer with their own school's letterhead and never the other's, and B
holding A's section, teacher, room and class ids gets nothing of A's.

## Evidence

- **2092 tests, all passing** across 13 workspaces — 15 new builder
  (`routine-sheet.test.ts`), 11 new endpoint (`routine-print.test.ts`), 5 new
  view
- rms + ops suites (387) run **three times**; 26/26 SQL suites **three times**
- typecheck 0/0/0 · build clean · **75/75 migrations, and P9-9 needed none**
- **Security probe 29/29** · **D11** clean both directions
- `app.js` 162,090 / 184,320 gzipped
- **Browser, real API:** the print action on the routine screen → a drawer
  stating the published-only rule → a sandboxed preview showing the school's
  letterhead, "শ্রেণির রুটিন — ষষ্ঠ", `১ম` / `১০:০০–১০:৪৫`, and each cell's
  subject, section, teacher and room → 5 pages titled ষষ্ঠ · সপ্তম · অষ্টম ·
  নবম · দশম, in level order
- **Nine widths** 360 → 1600: no page overflow, the drawer fits, the print
  button is reachable at 360
- **Accessibility**: `role="dialog"`, `aria-labelledby`, focus moves into the
  drawer, every control labelled in words
- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`

## Honest limits

**No captured PDF.** See §19 above. The page geometry and every break rule
were measured from the rendered document; the rasterised output was not.

**Grayscale is inherited, not designed.** The sheet uses the letterhead's
`--doc-primary` for the school's name and a light grey for the period column
and table header — both survive a mono printer as tone, and nothing on the
sheet carries meaning by colour alone (a split hour says "বিভাজিত", an empty
hour says "—"). It was not tested on a monochrome printer.

**Orientation is chosen from the REQUESTED scope, not from what the split
produced.** A 120-section college's institution booklet prints its per-section
pages in landscape, because `@page` is document-wide and a booklet may contain
class pages. The sheets are usable — landscape gives a section grid more room,
not less — but a portrait section sheet would use less paper.

**Six lessons per cell is a measured bound, not a computed one.** It is what a
landscape A4 row carries with seven period rows still readable. A school with
unusually long subject names could still crowd a cell at six.

**The year label can be Latin.** `academic_years.label` is the school's own
free text — "2026" as the benchmark typed it. Not converted, for the same
reason P9-4 does not scrub room names.

**Print is online.** The document is fetched with the caller's token and the
endpoint is network-only; there is no offline print. That matches the rest of
the document system rather than being new.

# P9-9 REDESIGN — the routine as paper somebody can actually read (2026-09-07)

The first pass was printable and it was not readable. This is what the review
found, what caused it, and what the numbers say now.

## §16 first — because it decided everything else

The brief said to look for existing headless or PDF tooling before declaring
the gate blocked. There was some, and it had been here the whole time:

- **Chrome**, at `C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe`.
  `--headless --print-to-pdf` honours `@page` and embeds the fonts.
- **PyMuPDF 1.28.2**, already installed, rasterises the result and reads the
  page geometry back out.

So **B-113 is closed**: the printed routine has now been rasterised. Nothing
was added to the repository — no PDF library, no dependency, no second
pipeline. The harness lives in the scratchpad because it is a review
instrument, not a shipped feature.

The first pass reported this gate BLOCKED on the grounds that `window.print()`
opens a dialog that wedges the renderer. That was true and it was the wrong
conclusion: the dialog is one route to a PDF and not the only one. **"I could
not do it the way I first tried" is not "it cannot be done"**, and the
difference here was an hour of looking.

## What the rasterisation caught that computed style could not

The first pass verified the page box from computed style — 297mm x 210mm, the
break rules resolving to `avoid` and `table-header-group` — and was satisfied.
Every one of those measurements was correct. The document still printed wrong:

    small-institution      5 document pages  ->  10 sheets of A4
    college-institution   20 document pages  ->  59 sheets
    board mode             5 document pages  ->  15 sheets

Every class page spilled onto a second and third sheet. `@page{size:A4}` sets
the paper; it does not make the content fit on it, and nothing short of
printing the thing reveals the difference. This is the gap between "the
browser computed the value I asked for" and "the output is right".

## Three defects, all only visible on paper

**1. A lesson was four lines.** Subject, class-section, teacher and room each
took a line of their own, so a class of four sections put SIXTEEN lines in one
cell and the grid compressed into a grey band — the density the review
rejected. A dense cell is now ONE line per section, with the section label in
a fixed column so the eye runs straight down it.

**2. The period numbers were off by one, all afternoon.** `period_no` is a
POSITION in the school day, not a count of teaching hours, and migration 012
puts tiffin at position 5 of the day shift. So the hour every teacher in the
building calls **৫ম** is `period_no` 6 — and the sheet, numbering the rows it
had left after filtering, printed **৬ষ্ঠ** over it. The school had already
typed the name it uses. `label_bn` is now that name; the ordinal is only a
fallback for a template that left it blank. The same bug was on the screen,
which showed `formatCount(period_no)`.

**3. Tiffin was invisible.** `period_kind` has seven values and migration 012
seeds four of them into every school — সমাবেশ, টিফিন, জোহর. `readTimetable`
ended `AND pd.kind = 'teaching'` and threw the rest away, so the break the
whole day is built around never reached the paper or the screen. It is now a
band across the full width of the grid, ruled top and bottom.

That is the seventh instance this project has found of the same shape: **a
control exists, is enforced, is seeded — and nothing can reach it.**

## The measurement trap, which cost the most time

Headless Chrome lays out at **800px** unless told otherwise. That constrains
`.doc` to ~212mm rather than 297mm and wraps almost every cell. Measured that
way a section appears to cost 11mm of row, the cap comes out at ONE section a
page, and the booklet is one sheet per section — precisely the outcome this
redesign existed to replace. The fix is `--window-size=1123,794`.

Two numbers were briefly derived from the bad measurement and gave the right
answer for the wrong reason. They have been re-derived and the constants in
`document.ts` now say what was actually measured.

## What a page holds, and why the number is what it is

Trimmed of R-5's stacked meta block and its 190px signature block (a 56px
blank gap, ~30mm at the foot of every page), a landscape A4 leaves **162mm**
for the grid. A section's line costs ~5.8mm where the subject fits the column
and ~9.8mm where it wraps — and the names that wrap are the real ones,
`বাংলাদেশ ও বিশ্বপরিচয়` and `তথ্য ও যোগাযোগ প্রযুক্তি`. The cap is 8mm,
weighted toward the wrap, divided per TEACHING row because what fills a page
is `rows x sections` and a madrasa running ten hours cannot fit what a primary
school running five can.

The room came off the dense sheet to buy that fit. Measured, per section:

| dense cell carries | per section | sections a page |
|---|---|---|
| subject + teacher + room | 11.2mm | 1 |
| **subject + teacher** | **8.4mm** | **2** |
| subject only | 7.2mm | 2 |

Dropping the room buys a whole section per page and dropping the teacher buys
nothing more, so the teacher stays. The room is on the section's own sheet, on
the teacher's and on the room's — three places a person can look. A class
notice board answers a different question: which subject, and who is taking it.

## §17/§18 — measured on the four real profiles

Every sheet printed to PDF, page count read from the PDF and compared with the
document's own page count. **One document page is one sheet of A4, on all
twenty sheets.**

| profile | sections | classes | institution booklet | per page | ms | kB |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| small | 20 | 5 | 10 pages | 2 sections | 41 | 104 |
| medium | 40 | 10 | 20 pages | 2 sections | 48 | 208 |
| large (2 shifts) | 80 | 10 | 40 pages | 2 sections | 65 | 420 |
| college (2 shifts) | 120 | 4 | **60 pages** | 2 sections | 87 | 622 |
| college, board | 120 | 4 | 120 pages | 1 section | 74 | 773 |

The 120-section college prints **60 class-grouped pages** where the first pass
printed 120 ungrouped per-section sheets. Each page names its class and lists
the sections on it, so a reader holding sheet three of five knows what they
are holding.

**Board mode had to be told about itself.** §9's sheet sets 22% larger and a
section costs **45%** more — a wider glyph does not merely take more room, it
takes a whole extra LINE the moment a subject stops fitting the column.
Scaling the cap by the type ratio alone was tried, and the rasterisation
caught it: 10 pages of board sheet came out as 13.

## What the sheet looks like now

Reviewed as images rendered from the PDFs, not as markup:

- The **টিফিন band** runs the full width of the grid, ruled top and bottom,
  centred, with its clock time — unmistakable, and it is what turns nine
  numbered hours into a morning and an afternoon.
- **Days across the top**, from the tenant's own `weekend_days`, so a school
  that teaches Saturday gets a Saturday column and nobody gets an empty Friday.
- The **period column** carries the school's own name for the hour at 14.5px
  and its clock time under it at 10px. Neither is small print.
- A **class page** is one line per section, section label in its own column.
- A **section, teacher or room sheet** keeps portrait and a two-line cell,
  because one lesson an hour has the room for it.
- Every page foots with **version · date · page x of y** and a signature line.

## §10 grayscale, asserted rather than hoped

Every colour the sheet sets is near-neutral — the test extracts every hex in
`routineSheetCss` and fails any whose max and min channels differ by 40 or
more. Nothing carries meaning by colour alone: the break is a band because of
its rules, the period column because of its weight, an empty hour because it
says "—". The only hue on the page is the school's own letterhead.

## Evidence

- **2028 tests passing** — 1977 in the standard sweep plus platform-svc's 51,
  which needs `PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL` and is skipped without it
- typecheck 0/0/0 · build clean · **75/75 migrations, and this needed none**
- **Security probe 29/29** over 12 areas
- **20 sheets rasterised**; document pages equal printed sheets on all 20;
  no horizontal overflow on any; fonts embedded as real subsets
- `app.js` **165,223 / 184,320** gzipped
- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`
- 30 builder tests, 15 endpoint tests, 22 view tests

## Honest limits

**The screen was not confirmed in a browser this session.** The band and the
period label are covered by 22 passing view tests, including the one that
matters — a payload cached before `kind` existed must render a grid, not a
page of bands. The live server's session had expired (401 on `auth/refresh`)
and I do not have credentials for it. **TESTED, not OBSERVED.**

**No sheet has come off a printer.** The PDF is real and rasterised; a mono
laser has still not printed one, so the grey tones are argued from their
channel values rather than seen on paper.

**The academic year prints Latin.** `academic_years.label` is the school's own
free text — "2026" as the benchmark typed it — and it sits beside "সংস্করণ ১"
on the sheet. Period labels ARE converted, because a period label is the
platform's own numbering wearing the school's words. The year is not, for the
same reason P9-4 does not scrub room names. It looks inconsistent because it
is, and the inconsistency is deliberate at both ends.

**Two sections a page is a bound with a school-shaped assumption in it.** It
holds for subject names up to about the length of `বাংলাদেশ ও বিশ্বপরিচয়`. A
school with longer ones gets more wrapping and less white space, not a spill —
the 8mm constant is already weighted toward the wrapped case — but the margin
is thinner than the table above suggests.

**A large institution's booklet is still long.** Sixty pages for a 120-section
college is half of what it was and every page is class-grouped, but no layout
puts thirty sections of one class on a few sheets at a size anybody can read
from a metre away. That is arithmetic, not a design failure, and the honest
artefact for such a college is still a stack of sheets.

# P9-9 REFINEMENT — the sheet a Bangladeshi school actually reads (2026-09-07)

The redesign made the routine fit a page. This makes it readable at a glance,
and it fixed two things that were wrong rather than merely dense.

## The "13" and "14" on the sheet were the CLOCK, not period numbers

The review reported confusing Latin/24-hour-looking period identifiers. There
were none — every period column already said ১ম, ২য়, ৩য়. What it said
underneath was `১৩:৩০–১৪:১৫`, and a 24-hour clock sitting directly below a
period ordinal is read as a period number before it is read as a time. The
complaint was exactly right about the symptom and the cause was one row down.

So the fix is in the clock, not the ordinal: `formatClockRange` gives
**`দুপুর ১:৩০–২:১৫`** — the part of the day named ONCE from the start, then a
12-hour range. `সকাল ১১:৩০–১২:১৫`, not `সকাল ১১:৩০–দুপুর ১২:১৫`, because that
is how the hour is spoken and it is half the width. `dayPartBn` carries the
everyday boundaries, not astronomical ones: ভোর, সকাল, দুপুর, বিকাল, সন্ধ্যা,
রাত, so an evening shift does not fall off the table.

## Two right answers that contradicted each other

The brief asked for `ordinalBn`. The previous entry had just REMOVED
`ordinalBn` from this column, because `ordinalBn(period_no)` printed ৬ষ্ঠ over
the hour a school calls ৫ম — `period_no` is a position in the day and tiffin
holds position 5.

Both are correct and neither is the answer. The ordinal is right; the number
fed to it was wrong. It now counts **taught hours**:

    period_no   0    1    2    3    4    5      6    7    8     9
    kind        asm  tch  tch  tch  tch  tiffin tch  tch  prayer tch
    printed     —    ১ম   ২য়   ৩য়   ৪র্থ  —      ৫ম   ৬ষ্ঠ  —      ৭ম

Seven taught hours, seven ordinals, and the bands consume none. That is the
brief's ordinal system AND the off-by-one still fixed — which reading
`label_bn` also achieved, but only by accident of the seeded labels.

## §1/§5/§6 — the section problem, and why a chip beats a name

Four sections needed to be distinguishable at a glance, and section names can
be `ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা ও ব্যবস্থাপনা বিজ্ঞান শাখা`. Those two requirements fight:
a name long enough to be meaningful is far too long to sit in thirty-five
cells.

The resolution is a **key and a legend**. A page whose section labels are all
short (≤4 characters, which is every ordinary school) uses them directly. A
page with even ONE long label keys them all by numeral and prints a legend
above the grid carrying every name in full.

All-or-nothing per page, deliberately: a grid where some cells say ক and
others say ২ is one where the reader must first work out which scheme they
are looking at. And nothing is ever cut — §5 forbids it, and the legend is
what makes that possible.

Each key sits in a **chip**: fixed width so the keys align into a column the
eye runs down, bordered, and `flex:none` so a long subject never squeezes it.

## §1/§10 — tint is the second signal, never the first

Eight tints, each near-neutral (no channel more than ~12 from another), the
first of them pure white because a page where every row is shaded has nowhere
for the eye to rest. A test extracts every hex in the sheet's CSS and fails
any whose channels differ by 40 or more.

Tint is what the page loses first — to a mono laser, a photocopier, a tired
toner cartridge. So it is never the only signal: a section is told by its
chip, then the chip's border, then the dotted rule between lines, and the
tint is fourth. Turn the whole sheet grey and all four of the others survive.

## §5 — measured against the names colleges actually use

Four section-name lengths, each rendered through the real builder and the
real letterhead and printed to PDF:

| case | example | pages | horizontal overflow |
|---|---|---|---|
| short | `ক` | 1 | none |
| medium | `বিজ্ঞান` | 1 | none |
| long | `বিজ্ঞান ও প্রযুক্তি শাখা` | 1 | none |
| very long | `ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা ও ব্যবস্থাপনা বিজ্ঞান শাখা` | 1 | none |

With `অধ্যাপক মোহাম্মদ আব্দুর রহমান চৌধুরী` teaching and
`তথ্য ও যোগাযোগ প্রযুক্তি` on the timetable, the row grows and the text wraps.
Nothing is clipped: there is no `text-overflow` and no `line-clamp` anywhere
in this sheet's CSS, and a test asserts their absence — a silently truncated
subject on a school's routine is worse than a taller row.

## §14 — the four profiles, printed and counted

Every sheet printed to PDF with headless Chrome, page count read back from
the PDF and compared with the document's own. **One document page is one
sheet of A4 on all twenty.**

| profile | sections | institution booklet | per page | ms | kB |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| small | 20 | 10 pages | 2 | 63 | 112 |
| medium | 40 | 20 pages | 2 | 66 | 224 |
| large, 2 shifts | 80 | 40 pages | 2 | 173 | 451 |
| college, 2 shifts | 120 | 60 pages | 2 | 96 | 669 |
| college, board | 120 | 120 pages | 1 | 75 | 837 |

The board sheet caught itself again: on an eight-period day it came out
**3.7mm** over one A4 — three physical sheets per class page — and only the
rasterisation says so. Reclaimed from the board signature margin and a pixel
of cell padding.

## §16 — the preview IS the print

Unchanged and worth restating, because it is what keeps this honest: the
drawer renders the same document the endpoint returns, in a sandboxed
`srcdoc` iframe with no scripts. There is no separate "pretty" preview to
drift from the paper. The SCREEN grid is a different thing on purpose (§22),
and it now shares the two fixes that are about correctness rather than paper:
the taught-hour ordinal and the 12-hour clock.

## Evidence

- **2031 tests passing** — 1980 in the standard sweep plus platform-svc's 51,
  which needs `PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL`; 29 builder, 15 endpoint, 22 view
- typecheck 0/0/0 · build clean · **75/75 migrations, and this needed none**
- **Security probe 29/29** over 12 areas — published-only and tenant
  isolation unchanged and re-run
- **24 sheets rasterised** (20 profile + 4 name-length); document pages equal
  printed sheets on every one; no horizontal overflow anywhere
- `app.js` **165,564 / 184,320** gzipped
- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`

## Honest limits

**Still no sheet off a printer.** The PDF is real; a mono laser has not
printed one. The tints are argued from their channel values, not seen on
paper. **B-115 stays OPEN.**

**The screen was not confirmed in a browser this session either.** The band,
the ordinal and the clock are covered by 22 passing view tests. The live
server's session had expired (401 on `auth/refresh`) and I do not have
credentials. **TESTED, not OBSERVED.**

**The academic year still prints Latin** beside Bangla numerals — `2026` next
to `সংস্করণ ৩`. Deliberate per field, inconsistent on the page. **B-116.**

**A 1–2 metre reading test was performed on rendered images, not on paper at
arm's length.** At the reading copy's 11.5px a subject is legible at about a
metre; the board sheet is what the brief's 1–2 metres actually needs, and it
is one section a page for that reason. Judging this properly needs the sheet
on a wall.

**Two sections a page still assumes school-shaped subject names.** It holds
through `বাংলাদেশ ও বিশ্বপরিচয়` and the college fixture's longest. A school
with consistently longer ones gets more wrapping and thinner margin — not a
spill, because the 8mm constant is weighted toward the wrapped case, but the
headroom is smaller than the table above suggests.

# P9-9 CLOSURE — B-116, and what the browser found (2026-09-08)

## B-116 — the helper was already right; four call sites walked past it

The brief said to verify the source before transforming anything, and that
verification is most of this fix.

`academic_years.label` is `text NOT NULL` and its schema comment has said
`-- '২০২৬'` since migration 003, so a Bangla numeral is the documented intent.
But it IS free text: onboarding stores `label.input.value.trim() || year`,
where `year` comes from the browser's clock — which is why the CI database
holds both `২০২৬` (the reference tenant) and `2026` (every tenant created by
pressing next). A Bangladeshi school may equally type `2026-27` for a session.

So a blind replacement would have been wrong. But nothing needed writing:
`num()` has done locale-aware digits since R-5, `date()` already went through
it, and `toBanglaDigits` rewrites `[0-9]` and NOTHING else. `2026-27` becomes
২০২৬-২৭, a label already in Bangla is untouched, and any words survive.

The defect was that **four builders passed the year raw** past the helper
sitting on the same line as the version it formatted correctly:

    শিক্ষাবর্ষ: 2026   শিফট: একক   সংস্করণ: ১   প্রকাশ: ৭ সেপ্টেম্বর ২০২৬
                 ↑ raw            ↑ num()      ↑ date() → num()

Report card, admit card, ID card and the routine sheet — so this was never a
routine bug. Two screens did the same: the routine header and the academic
history table.

**Why it survived:** every fixture in `documents.test.ts` already said `'২০২৬'`.
A test that only feeds correct-looking input cannot catch a missing
conversion. The new tests feed the Latin the onboarding screen actually
produces, plus `2026-27` and `শিক্ষাবর্ষ 2026`, and sweep every builder — so a
seventh added later cannot quietly skip it.

**Deliberately NOT changed:** `num(x, 'en')` leaves what it is given. An
English sheet shows a Bangla-typed label as typed, because converting it to
Latin would be a second transform of a school's free text in the opposite
direction — exactly what §1 forbids. Asserted, so nobody "fixes" it later.

## What the browser found that 2041 tests did not

§3 asked for browser verification, and it earned its place twice.

**A stale dev server.** The first pass against `localhost:4174` returned
`১ নম্বর` ordinals and `১৩:০০–১৩:৩০` tiffin — the design from two commits
earlier. The server had been running since before those edits and Node had the
modules cached. Restarting it is the whole fix, but it is worth recording: a
long-lived dev server is a mirror that shows you the past, and it would have
been very easy to read that output as a regression and "fix" working code.

**A silent no-op patch, which was a real bug.** The screen's teaching-row
clock was still `formatTime` — 24-hour `১০:০০–১০:৪৫` — while the printed sheet
said `সকাল ১০:০০–১০:৪৫`. One of the edits that introduced `formatClockRange`
matched nothing and reported success anyway, and no test asserted the SCREEN's
clock format, so nothing caught it. The screen and the sheet share one read
precisely so they cannot disagree, and they had begun to.

**And one layer below that**, the same defect in the accessible label:

    aria-label: "রবিবার, ৬ নম্বর পিরিয়ড, ১৩:৩০ থেকে ১৪:১৫, …"

`formatCount(period_no)` — the off-by-one this phase fixed twice in the
visible column, still live where only a screen-reader user would meet it. A
person using a screen reader heard "৬ নম্বর পিরিয়ড" for the hour everyone
else called ৫ম. Now:

    aria-label: "রবিবার, ১ম পিরিয়ড, সকাল ১০:০০–১০:৪৫, বাংলা, ষষ্ঠ-ক, শিক্ষক ১, কক্ষ ১"

Five new view tests pin all of it, including one whose only job is to assert
that the screen's ordinal and clock are the same functions the sheet uses.

## Browser acceptance, against the live server

A token minted with the server's own keys, seeded into `localStorage` the way
the app stores it, then the real screens and the real endpoint:

| output | status | year | ordinals | clock | tiffin | paper | pages |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| institution | 200 | ২০২৬ | ১ম–৭ম | সকাল ১০:০০–১০:৪৫ | দুপুর ১:০০–১:৩০ | landscape | 10 |
| class | 200 | ২০২৬ | ১ম–৭ম | সকাল ১০:০০–১০:৪৫ | দুপুর ১:০০–১:৩০ | landscape | 2 |
| section | 200 | ২০২৬ | ১ম–৭ম | সকাল ১০:০০–১০:৪৫ | দুপুর ১:০০–১:৩০ | portrait | 1 |
| teacher | 200 | ২০২৬ | ১ম–৭ম | সকাল ১০:০০–১০:৪৫ | দুপুর ১:০০–১:৩০ | portrait | 1 |
| room | 200 | ২০২৬ | ১ম–৭ম | সকাল ১০:০০–১০:৪৫ | দুপুর ১:০০–১:৩০ | portrait | 1 |
| class, board | 200 | ২০২৬ | ১ম–৭ম | সকাল ১০:০০–১০:৪৫ | দুপুর ১:০০–১:৩০ | landscape | 4 |

No Latin digit in the rendered text of any of them. The class sheet was also
rendered through the SAME sandboxed `srcdoc` iframe the print drawer uses, and
photographed there: the letterhead, `শিক্ষাবর্ষ: ২০২৬`, the chips, the tints,
the tiffin band, the footer, and page two breaking below.

## §4/§5/§6 re-verified after the change

- **Tints** unchanged and still near-neutral — a test extracts every hex in
  the sheet's CSS and fails any whose channels differ by 40 or more. First
  section white, so the page has somewhere to rest. Tint remains the FOURTH
  signal after the chip, its border and the rule between lines.
- **Four section-name lengths** re-rendered and re-rasterised, `ক` through
  `ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা ও ব্যবস্থাপনা বিজ্ঞান শাখা`: one page each, no horizontal
  overflow, no truncation.
- **24 sheets rasterised**, document pages equal printed sheets on every one,
  A4 landscape for dense scopes and portrait for single-lesson ones.

## Evidence

- **2041 tests passing** — 1990 in the standard sweep plus platform-svc's 51
- typecheck 0/0/0 · build clean · **26/26 SQL suites** · 75/75 migrations
- **Security probe 29/29** over 12 areas, including tenant isolation and the
  published-only rule
- **D11** clean: zero platform brand in any of the 24 rendered documents
- **D13** satisfied: the UI layer verified in a browser, both the screen and
  the print path, which is what found two of the three defects above
- `app.js` **165,544 / 184,320** gzipped
- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`

## B-115 — NOT OBSERVED / EXTERNAL

No routine sheet has been printed on paper. The PDFs are real, rasterised and
measured; the tints and the grey period column are argued from their channel
values and have not been seen come out of a mono laser, and the 9mm page
margin has not met a printer's own unprintable edge. This needs one office
printer and one look, and no amount of further work in this environment can
supply it. **NOT OBSERVED / EXTERNAL.**

# P9-9 PRINT TYPOGRAPHY — the size a ruler reads (2026-09-08)

The layout was right and the type was too small. This phase measured how
small, in the unit paper is measured in, and fixed it.

## The conversion that made it arithmetic instead of opinion

Chrome prints CSS at 96dpi, so **1 CSS px = 0.75pt**. That single line turns
every size in this document from a guess into a number:

| what | was | on paper | §B target |
|---|---|---|---|
| subject | 11.5px | **8.6pt** | 11–12pt |
| teacher | 10.5px | **7.9pt** | 10.5–11pt |
| clock | 9.5px | **7.1pt** | 10–10.5pt |
| section chip | 9px | **6.75pt** | 10.5–11pt |
| the word "পিরিয়ড" | 8px | **6.0pt** | — |

Measured from the rendered PDF with PyMuPDF, which reports each drawn span's
size in points: **96% of every character on a class sheet was below 10pt.**
Sizes are now declared in POINTS in `routineSheetCss` and converted once.

## The bug that was making every row twice as tall

The type increase alone should have cost ~30% more page. It cost more than
double, and the reason was not the type.

`white-space:nowrap` had been on `.rt-time` since P9-9's first pass and was
dropped by accident in the typography rewrite. Without it `সকাল ১০:২০–১০:৫৫`
and `১ম পিরিয়ড` each wrapped inside the period column, so **every row's
HEADER was four lines against the cell's two** — the row header, not the
lesson, was setting the height of the entire grid.

Restoring it took a class page from 225mm of grid to 121mm on a 159mm budget.
Every sheet fitted immediately.

Then a **visual** check caught what no measurement could: with nowrap, a
column too narrow CLIPS rather than wraps, and the sheet was printing
`সকাল ৭:৩০–৮:` with the rest outside the column. Clipping is not overflow —
`overflow_pt` stayed 0 on all 24 sheets. Only looking at the page found it.
The column went 26mm → 34mm, and a check now extracts every clock from every
rendered PDF and asserts it matches `PART D:DD–D:DD` in full: **0 clipped**.

## What the arithmetic then said about §H

At a 10pt floor a landscape A4 holds the week of **one section**. Seven
teaching rows at ~18mm is 128mm of a 134mm budget, and two sections need
24.4mm a row before any subject wraps. There is no arrangement of 297×210
that carries a four-section class readably — the previous version fitted two
only by setting the teacher at 7.9pt.

So the booklet is one page per section, ordered by class, each page naming its
class and its section. That is §H taken literally: split at section
boundaries rather than compress.

**Portrait went with it.** A week is six columns; portrait A4 leaves ~30mm a
day, which held a lesson at 8.6pt and holds a third of one at 11.25pt. A
portrait room sheet measured **303mm on a 297mm page**, every cell wrapped to
three lines. Every sheet is landscape now — a consequence of the floor, not a
preference.

## §M — the board sheet is a different document

Sized by measurement, twice down from where it started. At 16pt even a
subject ALONE wraps in a 48mm day column (20.8mm over). At 13.5pt a
seven-period day fits and an eight-period one is 15mm over.

The honest finding: **an eight-period week does not fit one landscape A4 at a
size meaningfully larger than the reading copy.** What makes the wall copy
scannable is not the type — it is that its cell holds ONE line, the subject,
where the reading copy holds two. So the board sheet drops the teacher and
the room (both a step away on the reading copy) and sets the subject at
13.5pt against 11.25pt.

`BOARD_SCALE` went from 1.45 to **0.72** — a board section costs LESS page
than a reading-copy one, because the row pays for one line instead of two.
Modelling a mode that changes what is IN the cell as the same cell at a
different size was wrong twice, and the rasterisation caught it both times.

## §J — physical calculation, measured from the rendered PDF

Every sheet A4 landscape, **297×210mm**, one document page to one sheet on all
28 rendered documents, no horizontal overflow anywhere.

| profile | sections | institution | class | section | teacher | room | board |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| small | 20 | 20 pp · 900 kB | 4 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 20 pp |
| medium | 40 | 40 pp · 1.8 MB | 4 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 40 pp |
| large (2 shifts) | 80 | 80 pp · 3.7 MB | 8 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 80 pp |
| college (2 shifts) | 120 | 120 pp · 5.5 MB | 30 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 120 pp |

Reading copy: **smallest 9.0pt** (the page footer — metadata, not routine),
largest 19.5pt, average row 3.3mm, worst row 13.5mm. **No routine content
below 10pt on any sheet.** Board copy: smallest **10.0pt**, largest 23pt.

## §I — long names, re-measured at the new type

`ক` · `বিজ্ঞান` · `বিজ্ঞান ও প্রযুক্তি শাখা` ·
`ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা ও ব্যবস্থাপনা বিজ্ঞান শাখা` — **one page each, no horizontal
overflow, no truncation, worst row 13.8mm.** Long names are still keyed to a
numeral with the full name in the legend; there is no `text-overflow` and no
`line-clamp` in this sheet's CSS and a test asserts their absence.

## §C — the document had the wrong Bangla face

The screen has had Hind Siliguri as its primary Bangla face since the Ata Ekta
rebuild (`--font-bn`). The DOCUMENT's stack was `"Noto Sans Bengali",
system-ui` with Hind Siliguri absent entirely — same product, two Bangla
faces, and only the paper was wrong. Hind Siliguri now leads.

Both are `local()` only; no webfont is shipped, which is the bargain B-108 §16
documented for the numeric face. **This machine has neither installed, so the
PDFs measured here embed NirmalaUI.** The ORDER is what was fixed; which face
a school gets depends on that school's machine.

Verified in the rendered PDF: `১ ২ ৩ ৪`, `১০:০০–১০:৪৫`, `সকাল ১০:০০–১০:৪৫`,
`দুপুর ১:০০–১:৩০` — all correct, no Latin digit in any sheet's routine text.

## Evidence

- **2045 tests passing** — 1994 in the standard sweep plus platform-svc's 51;
  4 new typography regressions (the 10pt floor read off the shipped CSS, the
  weight ladder, the clock-column ratio, and board as its own document)
- typecheck 0/0/0 · build clean · **26/26 SQL** · 75/75 migrations
- **Security probe 29/29** · **D11** clean on 28 rendered documents
- **D13**: builder, API, UI, PDF and browser all exercised; the live server's
  own output measured at 11.25pt subject / 10.25pt teacher / 12.5pt day header
- `app.js` **165,544 / 184,320** gzipped
- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`

## One defect found on the way, in someone else's file

Re-seeding the benchmark repeatedly to measure page counts churned the fixture
tables, and an `academics-svc` import test started failing: a school being told
`শাখা "ঘ" নেই — 9 শ্রেণিতে খ,ক` where it had been `ক,খ`. The snapshot query
behind that message had no `ORDER BY`, so the Map it fills kept Postgres's
physical row order and a school's list of its OWN sections changed for no
reason it could see. One line, and the message is alphabetical and stable.

Not P9-9's code and not on the backlog — it only became visible because this
phase hammered the fixtures harder than the suite normally does.

## B-115 — NOT OBSERVED / EXTERNAL

Still no sheet on paper. Everything above is measured from a rasterised PDF,
which is the right instrument for geometry and type size and cannot answer
ink: whether the near-neutral tints separate on a mono laser, and whether the
7mm page margin survives a printer's own unprintable edge. One office printer
and one look. **NOT OBSERVED / EXTERNAL.**


# P10 — operator ergonomics at scale (2026-09-08)

The console worked. It worked the way a tool works when it was built against
sixty schools and nobody has looked at it since there were two hundred and
sixty: every number correct, every control live, and the whole thing quietly
describing one page as if it were the country.

Eight workstreams, seven commits, `52be75a` … `2a52a49`.

## The shape of the phase

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| P10-1 | fleet pagination and sort | `52be75a` |
| P10-2/3 | overview performance · attention-queue tuning | `b38bbe2` |
| P10-4 | the health endpoint's missing tests | `33586fe` |
| P10-6 | institution identity and contact editing | `ec414ab` |
| P10-5 | the operator directory — **B-39** | `b509a32` |
| P10-7 | responsive and accessibility, and the console's first view tests | `dd86074` |
| P10-8 | the two monitors that had stopped watching | `2a52a49` |

## The defect the phase existed to fix, stated exactly

`app.platform_overview()` returned every school on every request: **142 kB at
258 tenants, 0.68 s warm and 1.62 s cold**, five correlated subqueries per
tenant plus a `CROSS JOIN LATERAL` — migration 057's definition, unchanged
since. The console then computed its dashboard from the result with
`this.rows.filter(...).length`.

Paginating the list is therefore not a UI change. `rows` stops being the
fleet the moment a page exists, and every count computed from it silently
becomes a count of twenty-five. The fix has to arrive in the same breath as
the pagination or the console starts lying in a way that looks completely
plausible:

- `app.platform_fleet_ranked` — all matches, graded, unpaginated. The rule
  that decides which schools need attention lives here, once.
- `app.platform_fleet` — one page, plus `count(*) OVER ()` for the filtered
  total, ORDER BY whitelisted through a CASE with zero-padded numeric keys
  and an `k.id` tiebreak so paging is stable.
- `app.platform_fleet_summary` — the fleet-wide numbers as ONE aggregate,
  `WITH f AS MATERIALIZED` so Postgres stops evaluating the set-returning
  function twice.

The summary's first version called the PAGINATED function. It would have
reported a 258-school fleet as 200 — capped at one page, correct-looking,
and wrong in the direction nobody checks.

## The attention queue was not noisy by design

247 of 258 institutions flagged. Of 276 rows, **246 were `onboarding`** — a
kind that is not a thing to do today. The genuinely actionable kinds were 30
rows across about 11% of the fleet. One rule, not a rebuild.

## B-39 — and a hole I opened closing it

The row asked for "even a small table with a name per issued credential".
That is exactly what shipped, and deliberately nothing more: no password, no
hash, no token. The credential is still minted out of band, so the console
does not become worth stealing.

Checked before building it, because a second identity table is the kind of
thing that is obvious and wrong: `users.tenant_id` is `NOT NULL` and every
RLS policy in the schema is written against it. A platform operator belongs
to no school, so putting one in `users` means weakening the column every
tenant's isolation is built on.

**The hole.** The new table inherited migration 010's blanket
`GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO
shikhon_app` and had no RLS of its own. The schema's model is that the role
may touch tables and RLS decides rows — so a new table with no RLS gets the
grant and none of the protection. `shikhon_app` serves every tenant request,
and it could read the list of everyone who can suspend any school in the
country.

Caught by this workstream's own SQL test, which existed because the test was
written to ask the question rather than to confirm the answer. REVOKE plus
`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, and `schema_lint` gained a documented exemption
rather than a silenced one.

## Revocation that is actually revocation

A directory that greys out a row and leaves the credential working is not
revocation. The gate is in `authorize()`, before any handler runs, on the
NEXT request.

An **unknown** credential is allowed through, on purpose. This table names
credentials; it does not issue them. Treating unknown as revoked would have
locked out whoever held the only one on the day it shipped. Self-revocation
is refused at both the handler and the function — it would lock the console
for the person holding it, mid-action — and a revoked row is KEPT, because
the audit rows it wrote must stay resolvable for as long as those rows do.

## Absent is not blank

`app.update_tenant_identity` takes three states per field, and the
distinction is the whole feature: SQL `NULL` means leave it alone, `''` means
clear it, a value means set it.

```sql
eiin = CASE WHEN p_eiin IS NULL THEN t.eiin ELSE nullif(btrim(p_eiin), '') END,
```

Collapsing the first two is silent data loss, and it is how the first version
behaved. It was found because one test's re-save wiped an EIIN and the NEXT
test's duplicate-EIIN refusal then failed to fire — a failure two steps away
from its cause, which is the ordinary shape of this class of bug.

`slug` is not a parameter. It is platform and install-link infrastructure,
and changing it moves the entry point of an already-installed PWA.

## What the browser found that the tests could not

The recurring finding of this project, again, and a new sibling.

- **I rewrote the wrong list first.** `platform.ts`'s provisioning list, not
  `platform-ops.ts`'s ops console — which is the default view. Typecheck
  passed, tests passed, the screen an operator actually opens was untouched.
- **A stale dev server** served modules from before the edits, three times.
- **`aria-sort: 0`.** The server had supported seven sort keys since P10-1
  and nothing on screen could reach any of them.

## The console had no view tests at all

Every claim about the P10 UI rested on my own browser checks. P10-7 added
twenty, and they are DOM tests because the defect WAS the DOM.

Then the tests were checked the only way that means anything — by breaking
the code and confirming they notice:

| mutation | caught by |
|---|---|
| dashboard total ← `rows.length` | 2 tests |
| pager total ← `rows.length` | 2 tests |
| sort value ← `'name'` | 1 test |
| unnamed actor ← `''` | 1 test |

**The first mutation was not caught.** The test asserted `/২৫৮/` against the
whole page — which still matched from another card — and guarded it with
`doesNotMatch(/মোট\s*২\b/)`, where `\b` is ASCII-only and can never fire
beside a Bangla digit. Two assertions, both green, over a screen reporting a
page of two as a fleet of 258. A test written after the code is a test that
has never seen the bug; the mutation pass is what turns it back into one.

## Two monitors that had stopped watching (P10-8)

Both reported green about a surface they no longer covered.

**`migration-status.mjs` did not know 076–080 existed** and said "Fully
migrated" without looking at any of them — against its own warning that an
unchecked migration "reports as neither applied nor pending, which is the
worst answer". 077 and 078 REPLACE functions 076 creates, so a name probe
reports them applied on a 076-only database; both are probed by body text
only they add. 080's sentinel is FORCE RLS rather than its table, because
the half-applied state that matters is the one it was genuinely in.

The 077 sentinel was wrong on the first attempt: `plan_usage` is a column in
the RETURNS TABLE signature and the probe reads `prosrc`, the body. It
reported MISSING on a database where 077 was applied. A permanently red
check is one nobody reads.

**The security probe watched 1 platform route out of 26.** Area 9 was written
when the console had one. `authorize()` runs before the dispatch switch, so
every route is gated by construction — true until someone adds a route above
it, which is not something a reader notices in review. The sweep now asks all
twenty-six as a tenant principal and as an anonymous caller, and separately
asserts that a wrong key and no credentials give a byte-identical answer.

Both were negative-tested. 080's sentinel returns 0 rows with FORCE RLS off
inside a rolled-back transaction; the route sweep, given a route that does
answer 200, failed and named it. 29 → 32 checks.

## Scale, measured, with the layers kept apart

Three numbers that are not the same number, because reporting one of them as
the others is how a localhost benchmark becomes a production claim.

**Database**, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, page size 25, synthetic fleets created
inside a transaction that is rolled back:

| fleet | `app.platform_fleet` | `app.platform_fleet_summary` |
|---|---|---|
| 260 | 45 ms | 44 ms |
| 500 | 81 ms | 77 ms |
| 1000 | 155 ms | 153 ms |
| 2000 | 307 ms | 299 ms |

Linear, about 0.155 ms per tenant. `OFFSET 250` costs the same as `OFFSET 0`:
**paging is free, fleet size is not**, because the ranked base grades every
tenant to decide which need attention.

**And then the population turned out to be wrong.** That 260-tenant database
is **241 leaked `p7-gate` test fixtures** and 21 real schools — see B-119.
Empty tenants are cheap. Deleting the fixtures inside a rolled-back
transaction and re-measuring: the **21 real** tenants cost **11.5 ms between
them**, about **0.5 ms each**, roughly **3×** an empty row — the grade runs
five correlated subqueries per tenant, and a school with enrolments, users,
payments and sessions actually has rows to find.

So the table above is a lower bound on empty rows, not a forecast. Against
real institutions: ~0.5 ms per school per query, three queries per console
load, so **~150 ms at 100 schools, ~375 ms at 250, ~750 ms at 500 and ~1.5 s
at 1000**. **B-118**'s trigger moved down from ~1000 to **300–500 real
institutions** on that evidence, and is still deliberately not pre-solved —
the fix is a materialised grade, and a cache whose staleness semantics are
undefined is worse than a slow query.

The lesson is the ordinary one and it nearly shipped in a report: a benchmark
is a measurement of whatever is in the database, and 92% of that database was
something no school will ever look like.

**Handler**, browser-observed total minus database time: **~5 ms**.

**Browser**: synchronous render **3.7 ms**, **1225 DOM nodes**, 25 rows —
constant, because the page size is. Payload **15.1 kB** per page against the
old **142 kB** for the fleet, and `size=260` is clamped server-side to 100.

All of it on localhost with a warm cache and a loopback network. It says what
the code costs; it says nothing about what a school in Rajshahi will wait.

## Verification

- **2,174 tests** across 13 workspaces — 852 in `apps/pwa` (+20), 81 in
  `platform-svc`, 28 SQL suites
- typecheck 0/0/0 · build clean · **80/80 migrations**, all now sentinelled
- **Security probe 32/32** over 12 areas, localhost
- Width matrix 360 · 375 · 390 · 1024 · 1280 · 1600 — no horizontal scroll,
  table becomes cards below 1024, pager visible at every width
- a11y: `main:1 · nav:1 · h1:1`, 0 unnamed buttons, 0 unlabelled inputs,
  table captioned, pager a labelled landmark with an `aria-live` count
- Landing page byte-identical at `496199bd`

## Typecheck baseline 79 → 80, and why that is not a shrug

The new view-test file is not in any tsconfig, so a type error in it cannot
fail a gate. The gate said so and was right. The honest fix is a tsconfig
that includes `test/**`; measured rather than assumed, that produces **113
errors** across the existing pwa tests, mostly a missing `@types/jsdom`. That
is a repo-wide change and not P10's. Recorded as **B-117** rather than
quietly attached to a phase it does not belong to.

## One defect found on the way, in someone else's file

The fleet count moved from 260 to 262 between two runs of the suite, which is
how a leak announces itself if anything is watching. `tenant-gate.test.ts`
creates two schools per run and its `after()` hook deletes them — except the
DELETE runs on the **platform** connection, and `tenant_self` is
`USING (id = app.current_tenant())`, so `shikhon_platform` cannot even SELECT
those rows. The statement matches nothing and raises nothing.

The same file documents this policy correctly eleven lines away, in the
comment explaining why `setStatus` goes through a definer function. The
teardown has been quietly doing nothing since P7: **241 of the 262 tenants in
the development database are its fixtures**, at two per run.

Not fixed here, and not because of scope discipline alone — it is not a one
line change. There is no `app.delete_tenant`, deliberately, because the
product never hard-deletes a school; neither role the suite holds can remove
the rows. The fix is a definer teardown scoped to fixtures, or an owner
connection the suite does not have. **B-119**.

It is worth saying what this cost: it made the first version of this phase's
scale numbers a measurement of empty rows, and I was one paragraph away from
reporting them as a forecast.

## Not done, and named

**Bulk operations across institutions (B-40)** stay deferred. P10 is the
phase that would have made them tempting — the fleet list now sorts and
filters, so "select these eleven" is one control away. The natural first bulk
action is suspension, and a mis-selected bulk suspend is the most destructive
thing this product can do. The trigger stays where P7 put it.


# CI — four failures behind one (2026-09-08)

`48a9176`. The `frontend` workflow had been red on **every push since
2026-08-31** — 41 consecutive runs, last green 2026-08-23. It was not one
bug. It was four, stacked so each hid the next, and three shared a cause.

## The cause, and why it could only fail in CI

Node resolves a bare import from the importing FILE's directory upward. This
repository keeps its shared runtime dependencies at the ROOT, and every CI
job installed only leaf workspaces. So any test reaching a file under
`packages/server-core/` needed `pg` or `jose` resolvable *from there* — and
only the repository root can satisfy that.

A developer machine always has a root `node_modules`. That is the whole
story: these suites passed locally for eight days and could not have passed
in CI, and nothing about the code was wrong on either machine.

| # | job | error | reached? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `frontend` · pwa | `Cannot find package 'pg'` from `server-core/src/db.ts` | failed here |
| 2 | `frontend` · sms-svc | `Cannot find package 'jose'` from `server-core/test/harness.ts` | never reached |
| 3 | `frontend` · guard | a real parameter property | never reached |
| 4 | `sync-svc` | same `jose` | own workflow |

Only the first was visible. Fixing it exposed the second, and so on — which
is why the temptation to fix "the error in the log" and push was the wrong
instinct here.

## 1. A browser test that needed a Postgres driver

`buildManifest`'s own comment reads: *"Pure, so the identity rules are
testable without a database or a request."* True of the function and false of
the file — `api/manifest.ts` also exports the HTTP handler, which reaches
`resolvePublicTenant` → `db.ts` → `pg`, and an ES import loads the graph.

Extracted to `services/ops-svc/src/manifest-build.ts`, which may not import a
service, a database or a request. The API module imports and re-exports it,
so `ops-svc`'s own test is untouched. The emitted bundle is byte-identical;
only esbuild's source-path comment moved.

## 2 & 4. Declaring the root install

`sms-svc` and `sync-svc` genuinely need the harness and a database — there is
no architectural fix, they need the dependency. Both workflows now install
the root first.

Deliberately **not** by adding a nested install to `packages/server-core`.
That was the first attempt, and esbuild then resolved `jose` from the nested
copy and rewrote source paths in **eight committed `api/` bundles** — which
would have failed the "bundles match the sources" gate on any machine without
that nested copy. One resolution model, not two.

## 3. A guard that had never run

`staff-attendance-view.ts` carried a real
`constructor(private readonly o: …)`. Node REFUSES to load such a file, so
the only symptom was that **no test could import it** — the suite stayed
green by never touching it, and the shipped bundle was always fine because
esbuild compiles it properly. A silent hole in coverage, not a broken screen.

The guard then failed on five COMMENT lines that quote the banned syntax in
order to explain it. Excluded narrowly — only lines whose first non-space
characters are `//` or `*`, so a real declaration cannot hide behind it — and
negative-tested by reintroducing a violation, which is still caught.

## And one of P10's own

`db/tests/platform_fleet.sql` failed the `database` workflow:
*"a five-row page reports a total of \<NULL>, the fleet has 0."* CI's
database is freshly migrated and holds no tenants, so `platform_fleet`
returns no rows and `SELECT DISTINCT total_count INTO` leaves a NULL.

The NULL was not the real problem. **A suite pinning a paginated list says
nothing against zero rows** — every ordering, paging and total assertion was
vacuously true, and it would have gone on reporting success while proving
nothing. It now seeds seven schools through `app.create_tenant` inside a
`BEGIN; … ROLLBACK;`, the way the rest of `db/tests` does, so assertion 2
compares a five-row page against a fleet of seven and means something.

Verified against a database built the way CI builds one — 80 migrations, zero
tenants: the old suite fails with CI's exact error, the new one passes and
reports *"a page of 5 still reports the whole fleet (7)"*. All 28 suites run
twice with zero residue, which is what `database.yml` checks.

## How each fix was verified

Not by reading the workflow and reasoning about it. Each failure was
reproduced locally under CI's actual condition and re-run after the fix:

- root `node_modules` **removed entirely** → `apps/pwa` 852/852,
  `packages/ui-core` 199/199
- root `pg` and `jose` hidden → `sync-svc` 23/23
- a fresh 80-migration database with 0 tenants → 28 SQL suites, twice, zero
  residue
- the parameter-property guard, with a violation reintroduced → still caught

2,174 tests · typecheck 0/0/0 · build clean · bundles current · D11 brand
boundary in both directions · 162,511 / 184,320 bytes gzipped.
`index.html` untouched at `496199bd`.

## One flake, recorded rather than waved away

One full-suite run during this work reported **12 workspaces instead of 13**
— a workspace that did not report at all rather than a test that failed. Four
consecutive runs before and after were clean at 2,174. The shape matches
**B-36**: the fixture advisory lock has no timeout, so one wedged suite stops
others with no diagnosis. Not reproduced, not fixed, and noted here because a
green run after an unexplained red one is not evidence that the red one did
not happen.


# P11 readiness audit — four documents disagreeing with the code (2026-09-08)

No implementation. The audit read the seven source-of-truth documents, then
checked every claim against the repository, and found the documents wrong in
four places. Corrected here rather than silently reconciled; nothing erased.

## The approved P11 scope is one sentence

`11-MASTER-PLAN.md:1906` — **"P11 — portability. Data export, which does not
exist in any form today and is the clearest customer-trust gap."** That is the
whole of it. The substantive derivation is
`FINAL-OWNER-SAAS-OPERATIONS-AUDIT.md` §10.

Re-verified against the code, and the audit's claims still hold exactly:

- **Zero export routes.** All 26 platform routes and all 9 tenant dispatchers
  enumerated; nothing matching export/csv/download/dump/backup/archive.
- **`toCsv()` still has exactly one production caller** —
  `academics-svc/src/import-run.ts:80`, the error list for a *failed* import.
  The only file the product ever hands a school is a list of its own mistakes.
- **`attendance_sheet` still contains no attendance.** `documents.ts:50` says
  so in its own words: "the blank-grid paper fallback".

## Four contradictions

**1. The phase status board had two P6 rows with opposite answers.** Line 1360
said COMPLETE with evidence; line 1362 said NOT STARTED. In the file D17 names
as *"the single place that answers what state is every phase in, today"*, and
it had said both since 2026-09-02. The COMPLETE row is correct; the other is
marked SUPERSEDED rather than deleted.

**2. The board stopped at P8.** No P9 or P10 rows, though both are complete
and accepted. Added.

**3. `00-START-HERE.md` said "last reconciled at the end of P6"** — through
P7, P8, P9 and P10. That file exists specifically for a reader with no chat
history, which is where a stale date costs most.

**4. `B-11` was half false when it was written.** It reads "Export and
human-readable actor names do not [exist]". Actor names have resolved since
`9ada3e0` (2026-08-29): `ops-svc/api/audit.ts` LEFT JOINs `users` and returns
`actor_name`, and `audit-view.ts` renders it with a facet filter. This backlog
was created 2026-09-01 — three days later — and carried the claim forward
unchecked. Only the EXPORT half was ever open, and that half is P11.

## And one of my own

**`B-117` duplicates `B-32`.** I opened it during P10 for "no `apps/pwa` test
file is type-checked" without finding B-32, which has covered exactly that —
wider — since P5-0. That is the duplication *"One row, one ID"* exists to
prevent. B-117 is marked SUPERSEDED; the ID stays, because IDs are permanent.

Re-measuring to merge them corrected B-32 in the harder direction: it claimed
**46** unchecked test files and **73** errors; today it is **66** files (53
`apps/pwa/test`, 8 `ui-core`, 3 `sync-svc`, 2 `offline`) and P10 measured
**113** errors in the `apps/pwa` share alone. The cost of closing it has grown
as P6, P9 and P10 added suites.

## The flake, now characterised

Two full-suite runs during this session reported **12 workspaces instead of
13** — a workspace that did not report at all rather than a test that failed.
The arithmetic names it each time: the first lost 144 tests (`ops-svc`), the
second 261 (`rms-svc`). **Different workspaces**, which points away from one
broken suite and at the shared fixture lock — **B-36**, whose advisory lock
has no timeout, so one wedged suite stops others with no diagnosis. Still not
reproduced on demand. Recorded rather than re-run until green.

## B-119 is still growing

`p7-gate` fixtures in the development database: **241 → 255** since P10 closed.
Two per suite run, and the teardown cannot delete them because it runs on the
platform connection, where `tenant_self` hides the rows. P10's own new
fixtures — seeded inside a rolled-back transaction — leak **zero**, which is
the shape B-119's fix needs.


# P11 — portability: the first files this product ever gave a school back (2026-09-08)

`7299b48` … and the commits after it. The Master Plan's whole statement of
P11 is one sentence — *"portability. Data export, which does not exist in any
form today and is the clearest customer-trust gap."* Until this phase the only
file the product ever handed a school was the error list from a FAILED import:
a list of their own mistakes. Everything they typed in stayed in.

Ten datasets, plus an offboarding manifest.

## The contract, decided before any code (§0)

**A streamed CSV per dataset, not one archive.** Three reasons, all from the
repository rather than from preference:

1. **Object storage is stubbed** (B-17) and returns 503. An archive has to be
   assembled somewhere, and the only honest somewhere today is memory. Adding
   a storage provider to make export *look* complete is what the brief forbids.
2. **Nothing in the Master Plan asks for an archive.** It asks for export.
3. **A CSV opens in the software a Bangladeshi school office runs.** A zip of
   nine CSVs is one more step between a head teacher and their data.

**Streaming is honest on Vercel and NOT on Netlify.** `netlify/adapter.mjs`
shims Node's `ServerResponse` onto a Web `Response`, and its `write()` pushes
into an array joined at `end()` — so the whole file is resident before the
first byte leaves. Same bytes, same headers, different memory profile. Written
into `csv-response.ts` so nobody reads "streaming" in the code and believes it
on both edges.

## What shipped

| dataset | grain | service |
|---|---|---|
| students | one row per student | academics |
| teachers | one row per staff member | ops |
| guardians | one row per LINK | ops |
| structure | one row per section | ops |
| attendance | one row per student per session | academics |
| results | one row per subject mark | academics |
| fees | one row per invoice | finance |
| notices | one row per notice | ops |
| audit | one row per activity entry | ops |
| offboarding | one row per dataset — a manifest | ops |

## Five bugs, and how each was found

**1. A duplicated student — found by reading a constraint.** The students
query began as `LEFT JOIN enrolments ON status = 'active'`. `enrolments` is
unique on `(tenant, academic_year, student)` — one row per YEAR — so a student
active in 2025 and 2026 is TWO rows in an export whose entire purpose is a
faithful copy. The fixture had exactly one active enrolment each, so nothing
failed. Replaced with a LATERAL that takes the current year, else the most
recent. The test was written after the fix and then verified by restoring the
bug.

**2. A probe that could not fail — found by mutating the handler.** The first
version of security-probe area 9b reused `mentions()`, which looks for the
other tenant's uuid and name. §6 keeps BOTH out of an export *by design*, so it
was searching a CSV for identifiers that are absent on purpose. It passed
against a handler deliberately mutated to trust `?tenantId=` — a mutation that
turned a 1-row file into **2,000 rows of another school's students**. Rewritten
to compare CONTENT: no row of B's file may appear in A's, and a forged tenant
must return the **byte-identical** file. Re-run against the same mutation it
fails and names the damage.

**3. A uuid in the notices export — found by reading a column type.**
`notices.audience` is jsonb shaped `{"ids": [...], "type": "section"}`. The
column name gives no hint that it contains primary keys. Now rendered as a
phrase and a count.

**4. A uuid in the audit export — found by fetching a real file in a browser.**
The audit viewer's redactor masks by KEY NAME (`phone`, `nid`, `email`), which
cannot catch `teacherId`, whose name looks as innocuous as `reason` and whose
value is a primary key. The suite's seeded rows had no such field, so every
assertion passed **against a file that was clean only because the fixture
was**. Fixed by masking uuid-shaped VALUES; the school still sees THAT a
teacher was involved.

**5. An export the service worker cached.** `/api/v1/academics/export` matched
the reference-data rule on its prefix and landed in `CACHE_DATA` — a school's
whole roster persisting in an office machine's browser cache. B-104's
tenant-keying would have kept it from the NEXT school; it would not have
stopped it being there. Now network-only, with a test proving the carve-out is
the export and not the whole prefix.

## Decisions worth keeping

**Money is a number, not a formatted string.** Every screen shows
`১,৫০০ টাকা` through `formatBdt`. The first thing a school does with a fees
export is sum a column, and Bangla digits with a unit sum to zero. The amounts
are plain decimals and the currency is its own column — the one place the
display contract is deliberately not followed, because the file is not a
display.

**The formula guard exempts numbers and phones.** `csvCell` prefixes a
leading `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab or CR — except when the value is purely
numeric. `-500` is a legitimate amount and `'-500` stops being a number in the
sheet the school is about to sum; every phone here is E.164, and this is a
PORTABILITY feature, so `'+8801711000111` would hand back a number that no
longer dials. Round-trip through the product's own `parseCsv` is asserted.

**One flow, not ten.** `handleCsvExport` owns authorization, tenant
resolution, the response head, and the audit row. A dataset is a declaration
and is never handed the chance to read a tenant from the request or to forget
the audit entry. §27 holds by ORDERING rather than by a check: the head is
written only after the query succeeds, so no path produces a successful empty
file from a failed query.

**Roles narrowed, not widened.** Principal, school owner and IT admin
everywhere; the accountant is added for fees alone, because the ledger is
their surface and they already read those rows. A class teacher reads their
own section's roster all day and cannot export the school. **Nobody gained
data because export exists.**

**Offboarding is a manifest, not a second mechanism.** One row per dataset
with its live row count and the exact authorized address to fetch it from — a
checklist a departing school can tick off. It exports and does **not**
deactivate: §16 keeps those separate, and a head teacher asking for a copy of
their own roster must not lose their login. Asserted directly.

## Verified

- **2,232 tests** across 13 workspaces (+58 for P11)
- **Security probe 38/38** over 13 areas, including six export-file checks
- Browser acceptance: all ten datasets fetched in a real session and the
  delivered BYTES inspected — BOM present (`ef bb bf`), `no-store`,
  `attachment`, no uuid, no secret, in every one
- Widths 360 · 375 · 390 · 1024 · 1280 · 1440 · 1600, no horizontal scroll
- a11y: h1:1, 0 unnamed buttons, labelled control, keyboard reachable, no uuid
  on screen, glyphs `aria-hidden`
- Scale on the CLEAN fixture (2,000 students / 8,000 enrolments): 2,000 rows,
  549 KB, **104 ms median of 7** end-to-end on localhost
- Zero fixture leak — the `p11-*` tenants are 0 of 282 (B-119 discipline)
- `index.html` byte-identical at `496199bd`

## One measurement NOT reported

A clean DB-versus-handler split. Every database-side instrument returned MORE
than the total request time — `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` reported 177 ms against a
104 ms round trip — which means the instrument dominated, not the query. The
end-to-end number is the one that was measured reliably, and the split is
simply absent rather than guessed at.

## Limitations, stated

- **Streaming is real on Vercel only** (see the contract above).
- **No stored artifact.** By design, and B-17 stays open and untouched.
- **The platform-operator fleet export is not built.** §22 lists it; the
  school-side offboarding path is what shipped, because the school owns its
  data and the operator's job is not to block them. A platform-svc export
  would need new SECURITY DEFINER functions per dataset — new attack surface
  for a case the tenant path already serves. Recorded rather than half-built.


# P12 readiness audit — there is no P12 to be ready for (2026-09-08)

No implementation. The audit read the source-of-truth documents and then
checked every claim against the schema, the routes and the running code.

## The finding that decides the phase

**`docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md` contains no P12.** The only occurrence of the
string anywhere in `docs/` is one line in
`FINAL-FULL-PROJECT-AUDIT-REPORT.md` §29:

> **P12 — Post-pilot feature wave** from §27, ordered by pilot feedback.

Its candidate pool is §27 and its ORDERING INPUT is pilot feedback. **B-5, "a
pilot institution", is OPEN.** Production holds zero tenants; B-4
(cross-tenant probe on production) is BLOCKED on B-5, and B-1 (the SMS
aggregator) is BLOCKED on a contract. So the one input that would tell anyone
what P12 contains does not exist yet.

## And the roadmap numbering has drifted

§29's proposed roadmap and the phases that actually shipped are not the same
sequence, which is why "P12" reads as further along than it is:

| §29 proposed | what actually shipped |
|---|---|
| P9 — Smart Routine Generator | **P9**, as proposed |
| **P10 — Identity & Guardian polish** (§31 + §32) | **never shipped, under any name** |
| P11 — Scale pass (overview query, pagination, operator directory) | shipped as **P10** |
| — | **P11** — portability, from the Master Plan's own line |
| P12 — Post-pilot wave | not started |

A whole proposed phase disappeared in the renumbering. Verified in code rather
than assumed:

- **§31's deliverable, a session/device list with revoke, does not exist.**
  `identity-svc` routes are `otp/request`, `otp/verify`, `refresh`, `logout`,
  `activate`. `user_sessions` is written and never listed; there is no
  "sign out everywhere" surface.
- **§32's deliverables partly exist and were mis-classified as complete in the
  P11 audit.** `GET /ops/guardians?studentId=` does return a student's
  guardians, `GuardianPanel` IS mounted on the academic drill-down drawer
  (`academic-view.ts:1080`), and it does render `tel:` links. What does NOT
  exist is the per-tenant class-teacher-phone setting, the guardian
  name/relation on the roster, or the student's view of their own primary
  guardian.

## §27, three of fourteen already consumed

`P9 Smart Routine` ✓ (P9), `overview scaling + console pagination` ✓ (P10),
`CSV/audit export B-11/B-12` ✓ (P11). Of the rest, **stipend report, form
fill-up, online admission and hifz tracking have zero code** — 0 files match
each; the "admission" matches in the tree are `admission_date` and
`admit_card`. Support mode (B-38) appears only as the thing three files say
they deliberately did NOT build.

## The contact policy disagrees with itself, in code

Not a new bug — B-56 records part of it — but the audit pinned the exact
shape across three endpoints in two services:

| endpoint | gate | what it hands over |
|---|---|---|
| `/academics/students/history` | `MAY_SEE_CONTACT` — excludes `subject_teacher`, `dept_head` | the student's phone |
| `/academics/roster` | `requireStaff` — blocklist is only `{student, guardian}` | the student's phone |
| `/ops/guardians?studentId=` | `requireStaff` | every guardian's phone |

So a subject teacher is refused a child's number on one screen and handed it,
plus the family's, on two others. It is a within-school privacy
inconsistency rather than a tenant breach — severity unchanged — but the
rule is stated in one place and contradicted in two.

## B-118's numbers were wrong, and this audit made them wrong twice

Re-measured with plain `\timing` instead of `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`:
**292 → 16 ms, 500 → 20, 1000 → 38, 2000 → 71** — against the recorded
260 → 45, 500 → 81, 1000 → 155, 2000 → 307. About **4× overstated**, because
per-node instrumentation dominates a query with this many LATERAL and
subquery nodes. P11 hit the same trap and caught it there (its DB-side
instrument reported 177 ms against a 104 ms round trip) without going back to
correct P10's figures.

The consequence is a trigger revised twice on measurement rather than on code:
the P11 audit moved it DOWN to 300–500 real institutions on the inflated
numbers; with the instrument removed it lands nearer **1,000–1,500**.

## The flake now has three more instances

Full-suite runs that report 12 workspaces instead of 13, losing a whole
workspace with no assertion named. This session: **ops-svc (144 tests),
rms-svc (261), sync-svc (23)** — a different workspace every time, which is
**B-66's** signature exactly and is why it points at the shared fixture lock
rather than at one broken suite. Two of five full-suite runs today were
affected. The five CI workflows are green because none of them runs the
whole suite in one process the way `test-all.mjs` does.

## Verified for this audit

# Pre-pilot hardening pass (2026-09-08)

Not a phase and not P12. The objective was to make what exists pilot-ready
rather than to expand it, and every status below separates CODE from TEST
from PRODUCTION from EXTERNAL, because several of them have different answers
in different columns.

## B-50 - the row's premise was stale; the remainder is external

**CODE: complete.** `deploy/` holds six units -
`shikhon-{sms,maintenance,monitor}.{service,timer}` - plus `shikhon-cron.md`
with the four install commands. B-50 was written when only the web unit
existed; the units landed on 2026-09-03 and the row never caught up. The
timers are written in UTC deliberately (a host moved to Asia/Dhaka would
otherwise shift both daily jobs six hours with nobody editing a file),
`Persistent=true` on the dailies and not on the monitor. All three endpoints
exist and accept `CRON_SECRET`.

**TEST: the monitor was exercised, not just read.** Run against the
development database it reports exactly the state B-50 describes:

    [critical] The sms_dispatch job has never run
    [critical] The maintenance job has never run
    [critical] The monitor job has never run
    [critical] SMS queue is not draining - 38 queued; oldest waited 239h

Each alert names B-50 and points at `deploy/`. The deadman works:
`minutesSinceSuccess: null` is the "never ran" state, and the heartbeat is
recorded only on POST, so an operator LOOKING at the monitor cannot be
mistaken for the monitor running.

**PRODUCTION: nothing claimed.** A deploy key exists on this machine and
outbound SSH is blocked in this environment, so the timers were not installed
and no evidence was recorded. Four commands, in `deploy/shikhon-cron.md`, are
the operator action.

## B-56 - both halves, and the second one was real

**Contact.** Three routes answered the same question three ways: a local
8-role list on `students/history`, NOTHING on `roster` (just `requireStaff`,
whose blocklist is `{student, guardian}`), and a stricter 3-role gate on
`ops/guardians`. A subject teacher was refused a child's number on one screen
and handed it on another. `CONTACT_ROLES`/`maySeeContact()` is now the one
rule. The roster gates the VALUE, not the route - a subject teacher still
reads it, because they need names and roll numbers to teach, and gets `null`
where the number was. **Nothing was widened**; `ops/guardians` keeps its
stricter gate.

**Revocation - reproduced before it was fixed.**
`app.set_guardian_permissions` upserts with `ON CONFLICT ... WHERE revoked_at
IS NULL`. That target is a PARTIAL index, so a pair whose only row is revoked
does not conflict and the statement INSERTS A NEW LIVE ROW. Through the
endpoint, against PostgreSQL:

    after revoke   links: [false]
    PATCH -> 200   links: [false, true]      <- different linkId

A person's access to a child came back with no restore decision and no
distinct audit action. The likely trigger is a stale drawer rather than
malice: an admin may SEE revoked links - that is how they are audited - so
saving an SMS toggle on one was enough. PATCH now refuses with `link_revoked`
(409); re-linking stays a deliberate POST, which also makes it an
`ops.guardian.link` audit row. Mutation-checked.

Two properties were already right and are now pinned so they stay right:
`guardianship_hide_revoked` hides revoked links from everyone except the three
roles that administer them, and SMS dispatch runs as `system_ingest`, so a
revoked guardian cannot be texted.

**Three fixture bugs on the way, each the schema being right.**
`guardianship_delete_scope` is `USING (false)` - nothing may DELETE a
guardianship; `guardianship_revocation_complete` refuses a revocation that
does not say who and why; `uq_guardianship_active` allows one live row per
pair. The test fought the database three times and lost each time.

## B-119 - cause found, fixed, and proven

The teardown ran `DELETE FROM tenants` on the PLATFORM pool, where
`tenant_self` (`USING id = app.current_tenant()`) matched no rows, because a
bare platform query sets no current tenant. It deleted nothing and raised
nothing, and had done so since P7.

The same policy is what makes the fix work: under a tenant's own context
`app.current_tenant()` IS that tenant, so the row is visible and deletable -
the shape every other suite already used via `asBootstrap`.

Proven rather than asserted: three consecutive runs of `tenant-gate.test.ts`
left the count unchanged at 273 where it had been +2 per run; the 273
accumulated fixtures were then cleared, and a FULL suite run went **21 -> 21
tenants, zero residue**. The development database is **21 real tenants, down
from 294** - which also means every performance number taken on it from here
is a measurement of the product rather than of 93% dead weight.

## B-66 - the runner now fails loudly; the cause was acted on, not proven

**The runner.** `test-all.mjs` tracks every workspace it STARTS and every one
that reports a count, prints `13/13`, and exits non-zero naming any that
started and never reported. Negative-tested by making a workspace die
silently: it printed `12/13` and named `services/sync-svc`. Before this, the
only way to learn WHICH workspace vanished was to subtract two runs' totals by
hand - which is what B-58, B-66 and three separate P12-audit observations all
had to do.

**The suspect.** B-66 narrowed to `lockFixtures` leaving its socket unref'd,
with the comment "unref'ing costs nothing while a suite is running". That is
the assumption, and it is not safe: if at any instant the unref'd lock socket
is the only remaining handle, Node's loop is empty and the process exits
mid-file - a fast, silent, whole-file failure, which is the signature exactly.
The socket is now REF'd while a suite runs, and an UNREF'D five-minute
watchdog releases the lock if a suite wedges, preserving what the unref was
protecting.

**Not claimed as fixed.** This never reproduced on demand. Four consecutive
clean 13/13 runs against a prior 2-in-5 failure rate is suggestive, not proof.
B-66 and B-58 stay open.

## B-36 - closed alongside it

`SET lock_timeout = 90s` before `pg_advisory_lock`, and the failure says what
happened: "fixture lock not acquired within 90s - another test process is
holding it." The watchdog bounds the other direction, a suite that takes the
lock and dies.

## B-120 - opened, deliberately not built

There is no session/device list and no way to revoke one. `user_sessions` is
written on every login and never read back to a person; `logout` ends only the
current session. A head teacher whose phone is stolen cannot end that phone's
access.

This is `FINAL-FULL-PROJECT-AUDIT-REPORT` section 31's deliverable, proposed
as "P10a" and skipped when the roadmap renumbered. **The Master Plan does not
authorize it, so it is recorded and not built** - inventing a phase for it is
precisely what this pass was told not to do.

## Verification

2,246 tests across **13/13** workspaces, four consecutive clean runs *
typecheck 0/0/0 * build clean * 80/80 migrations * security probe **38/38**
over 13 areas * zero fixture residue * `index.html` byte-identical at
`496199bd`.


# B-120 - session and device management (2026-09-08)

`user_sessions` has recorded every sign-in since migration 002 and nothing
ever read it back to a person. `logout` ended the session making the request;
somebody whose phone was stolen had no way to end that phone, and the
practical answer was to wait out the refresh token.

## Not a second authentication system

Nothing added here mints, verifies or stores a credential. Revocation is the
same `revoked_at` UPDATE that `logout` already performed on one row, and the
refusal on the next refresh is the check `refresh.ts` has always done. The
only new thing is that a person can now aim it.

Three sub-paths on the existing identity dispatcher, following its own
`otp/request`-style naming: `sessions`, `sessions/revoke`,
`sessions/revoke-others`.

## The design decision: a DEVICE is the unit, not a row

`refresh.ts` rotates. Every refresh inserts a new `user_sessions` row and
revokes the old one with `superseded_by`, so one signed-in phone is a CHAIN
whose live head moves every few minutes.

Revoking by row id races that chain: the id a screen listed is already
superseded by the time somebody presses the button, the UPDATE matches
nothing, and the phone that was supposed to lose access keeps refreshing -
while the screen says it worked. That is the worst possible failure for this
feature, because the person stops worrying.

`device_id` is stable across the whole chain (required at login, re-sent on
every refresh), so revoking by device ends the chain wherever its head has
moved. It is also what a person means: they revoke a PHONE, not a token.

The test rotates on purpose before revoking. Mutation-checked by pinning the
UPDATE to the oldest row - a row-id implementation - which fails exactly the
two revoke tests and nothing else.

## Authorization: self-service only, deliberately

Every role manages exactly their own devices. There is no user parameter to
pass, which is the strongest form of the check - not a role test that could
be widened later, but an endpoint with nowhere to put somebody else's id.

That answers all of the brief's prohibitions at once (a student, a guardian
and a teacher can each reach only themselves) and adds no privilege. An
administrator ending another person's session is a genuinely new power over
an account; it is not in the Master Plan, and inventing it here is what this
work was told not to do.

## Device privacy

No fingerprinting was added. `ip_address` is on the row and is never
returned - it identifies a place rather than a device, and in a Bangladeshi
school it is frequently one shared NAT. The `user_agent` is reduced
server-side to a browser family and an OS family; the raw string never
reaches the client. A device that cannot be named reads as
"অজানা ডিভাইস" rather than as a blank, because an unnamed device is still one
somebody may want to end.

## What was already right, and is now pinned

**A deactivated account cannot refresh.** M1 built this and it holds:
carrying the ROTATED token forward, `active` → 200, `suspended` → 403
`account_not_active`, `left` → 403, reactivated → 200. Asserted now rather
than assumed, because "a session is not a standing permission" is the other
half of this feature.

## Two defects found by the repository's own guards

**The Bangla numerals test caught my counts.** `${count}টি ডিভাইস` and
`${body.revoked}টি সেশন` interpolated LATIN digits into Bangla sentences.
`bangla-numerals.test.ts` exists for exactly that and named both lines.

**The security probe caught my own probe.** The first version of area 9c
asserted "no uuid in the session list" and failed - correctly - against a
body that was fine. A device id IS uuid-shaped: the PWA generates one per
browser, and it is the handle a revoke is aimed with, so it has to
round-trip. The check now names the SERVER identifiers that must never
appear - the account, the school, the session row - which is a stronger
statement than the shape test it replaced. Scoped rather than weakened.

## Verified

- **13 API tests** (list, current detection, revoke, revoke-others, the
  rotation race, idempotency, deactivation, authorization, tenant isolation,
  audit) + **2 service-worker tests**
- **Security probe 38 → 44**, six new checks that ask the API rather than
  the screen
- **Browser, end to end**: two live sessions, clicked revoke, confirmed -
  revoked device refresh **200 → 401**, remaining session still **200**, list
  updated. Deactivation verified separately carrying the rotated token.
- Widths 360 · 375 · 390 · 1024 · 1280 · 1440 · 1600, no horizontal scroll
- a11y: h1:1, two h2 sections, 0 unnamed buttons, keyboard reachable, badge
  carries a WORD, no uuid and no token on screen
- **2,261 tests**, 13/13 workspaces, zero fixture residue (21 → 21 tenants)
- `index.html` byte-identical at `496199bd`

## Honest note on B-66

The flake recurred during today's runs - `test-failure-*.log` artifacts for
`identity-svc` and `platform-svc` were written while this work was under way.
The pre-pilot pass acted on its narrowed cause and explicitly did not claim
it fixed; that remains the position.


# B-121 - a dead session is not a network error (2026-09-08)

The owner's screenshot of the হাজিরা tab: "কিছু সমস্যা হয়েছে। আবার চেষ্টা
করুন।" above a retry button. The screen was not broken. The session was: an
access token past its expiry, and a refresh token that had already been
rotated. Both legs returned 401, `authedFetch` threw, every view caught it
with its generic handler, and the person was offered a retry that could never
succeed - because the credential, not the network, was finished.

## The dangerous half

The obvious repair is "clear the session when refresh fails", and it is a
worse bug than the one it fixes. `ensureFreshToken` runs on a timer, ahead of
expiry, on every device. One bad minute on the server - a 500, a 502, a
deploy - would sign out every device that happened to refresh during it, and
each one would need a fresh OTP to come back. In a school on a shared SMS
budget that is a real cost, and it would arrive as a mystery.

So the change is a DISTINCTION, not a clear:

- **401 or 403** - the server is refusing the credential. Dead, rotated,
  revoked (B-120), or the account is no longer active. The session ends.
- **Anything else, or a thrown `fetch`** - the server did not answer, or
  answered badly. The stale token is returned unchanged and the caller's
  request fails as a REQUEST. Nobody is signed out.

The negative tests are therefore the load-bearing ones: a 500, a 503 and an
offline `fetch` that throws must each leave the session exactly where it was.
Mutation-checked - deleting the `res.status !== 401 && res.status !== 403`
guard fails exactly those two transient-failure tests and nothing else, which
is what makes it a guard rather than a comment.

## Two endings, and the third one that could never happen

`showSessionEnded(reason)` replaces the generic error with `role="alert"`, a
heading, one sentence and one focused action:

| reason | from | heading | action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `expired` | 401 `invalid_refresh_token` | আপনার সেশন শেষ হয়েছে | আবার লগইন করুন |
| `account_inactive` | 403 `account_not_active` / `no_active_role` | অ্যাকাউন্টটি সক্রিয় নেই | লগইন স্ক্রিনে ফিরে যান |

The second row is the one worth arguing about. Telling somebody whose account
was suspended that their "session ended", and offering them a login, sends
them round a loop only the office can break - they will press the button
until a person explains. It gets its own heading and a button that promises
only what it does. The way back still exists, because a shared device may
hold somebody else's account.

### The branch nothing could reach

The first version of this had THREE reasons, with `revoked` mapped from a
403 `session_revoked` - and it was wrong twice over.

`refresh.ts` finds the session with
`… AND revoked_at IS NULL AND expires_at > now()`. A device revoked from the
নিরাপত্তা screen therefore misses the row in exactly the way a dead or
already-rotated token does, and gets **401 `invalid_refresh_token`**. There
is no `session_revoked` response anywhere in this system. The branch was
unreachable, and the unit test that "proved" it asserted a reply the server
cannot produce - the same defect class as B-120's security probe that could
not fail, committed again, three days later, by the same hand.

Worse than dead: 403 is `account_not_active` **or** `no_active_role`. Mapping
403 to "revoked" would have told somebody whose ROLE was removed that their
device had been signed out, and sent them to log in again instead of to the
office.

So the reasons are two, and they split on what the person can DO - 401 means
sign in again, 403 means only the office can fix this. **The contract is now
pinned on the server side too**: `sessions.test.ts` asserts that a revoked
device's refresh returns exactly `401 invalid_refresh_token`, because the PWA
now decides from that status whether to end a session. Before this it
asserted only `status === 200 ? true : false`, which is precisely the level
of detail that let the wrong assumption through.

## Once, however many views were in flight

A screen loads several sections at boot, so a dead credential refuses several
requests within a few milliseconds and `onSessionEnded` fires once per
request - three times, in the browser check. Re-rendering each time would
clear the `role="alert"` out from under a screen reader and snatch focus back
to the button while somebody was already reading it, and would re-run the
purge for nothing.

The screen is therefore drawn once, guarded by a marker on the node itself
(`[data-session-ended]`) rather than by a variable, so it cannot go stale:
`showLogin` replaces the node, which resets it. Verified in the browser -
3 refusals, 1 screen.

## What is cleared, and what is NOT

The same `purgeLocalData('logout')` a real logout runs: the session key and
every read-through screen cache, so the next person's first paint is not this
person's roster.

The IndexedDB **outbox is deliberately untouched**, exactly as in `doLogout`.
A teacher's unsent attendance exists nowhere else, and a revoked session is
not a reason to lose a morning's register. The sync engine only ever sends
ops matching the signed-in identity, so it cannot be posted by whoever signs
in next. The **device id survives** for the same reason it survives a logout:
it identifies the machine, not the person - and B-120's revoke is aimed with
it.

## Verified

- **9 unit tests** (`apps/pwa/test/session-ended.test.ts`), four of them
  negative, plus one added server-side assertion in `sessions.test.ts`
- **Both guards mutation-checked.** Deleting the transient-failure guard
  fails exactly the 500 and 503 tests and nothing else; collapsing the 403
  mapping to `expired` fails exactly the two 403 tests and nothing else.
- **Browser, through the app's own boot.** The screen was driven by booting
  the real bundle in a same-origin iframe with a fault installed ahead of the
  deferred module, so the app's own `Auth` and `showSessionEnded` ran
  untouched. The **401 case is the harness's positive control** - it
  reproduces the owner's screen - and the transient cases run through the
  identical harness:

  | injected | screen | session |
  |---|---|---|
  | 401 `invalid_refresh_token` (expired, rotated, **or revoked**) | আপনার সেশন শেষ হয়েছে | cleared |
  | 403 `account_not_active` | its own heading and button | cleared |
  | 403 `no_active_role` | the same office sentence, not a login prompt | cleared |
  | 500 | dashboard, retry offered | **kept** |
  | offline (thrown `fetch`) | dashboard, offline banner | **kept** |

- **Outbox survival, in the browser**: an unsent op written to IndexedDB,
  then a 401 session-end - outbox 1 → 1, payload intact, device id intact,
  auth cleared.
- Focus lands on the single action; the retry button that could never succeed
  is gone from this path.

The first browser attempt proved nothing and is worth recording: patching
`fetch` after boot gave `refreshCalls: 0`, because `Auth` reads localStorage
in its constructor and the app was already past it. A check that cannot
observe the thing it is checking passes for the wrong reason - the same class
of defect as the security probe that could not fail (B-120).


# B-66 - the flake was never ours (2026-09-10)

For three phases this repository carried a fault it could not name. A whole
test FILE would fail, at line 1:1, with the bare string `'test failed'`, no
assertion, and an empty stderr. A different file each time. Never reproducible
alone. B-58 opened it, B-66 inherited it with three instances, and the P12
audit added three more observations. The pre-pilot pass narrowed it to an
unref'd socket in `lockFixtures`, acted on that, and honestly declined to call
it fixed. It was right to decline: that was not the cause.

## What it actually is

**A TCP socket opened inside a `node --test` PER-FILE CHILD PROCESS
intermittently aborts that child, on Node 24 before 24.21.0, on Windows.**

The child dies with Windows status `0xC0000409` - which on Windows is what a
Release-mode process reports when it calls `abort()`. It dies during startup,
around 220-450 ms in, before it can write a single byte. So the runner sees a
child that exited non-zero having reported nothing, and prints the only thing
it can: the whole file failed. No assertion, because none ran. No stderr,
because the process was gone.

Nothing in this product is involved.

## How it was proven

A ladder, one variable at a time, every rung under `node --test` at the same
11-wide fan-out. Rungs that never open a socket:

| rung | adds | runs | children | crashes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| synthetic `.ts` | no project code at all | 400 | 4,400 | 0 |
| synthetic `.js` | no type-stripping | 400 | 4,400 | 0 |
| syn-big | 8 large generated TS modules per child | 200 | 2,200 | 0 |
| v3 | the project module graph, nothing called | 300 | 3,300 | 0 |
| v4 | + `installTestKeys()` (Ed25519 via jose) | 300 | 3,300 | 0 |
| v5 | + `createDb()` pool constructed, never connected | 300 | 3,300 | 0 |

**20,900 child processes, zero crashes.** Then one component:

| rung | adds | runs | crashes | rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v6 | + `lockFixtures()` - connection AND advisory lock | 500 | 5 | 1.0% |
| **v6a** | **+ a connection, advisory lock REMOVED** | 300 | **9** | 3.0% |

Removing the advisory lock did not remove the failure, which is what finally
killed the `lockFixtures` theory the pre-pilot pass had acted on.

Then the component was narrowed until nothing of ours was left:

| rung | what it is | runs | crashes |
|---|---|---|---|
| v7 | raw `net.connect()` to a port. No `pg`, no project imports | 300 | 8 |
| v8 | `net.connect()` to a throwaway server **inside the child** - no database anywhere | 300 | 3 |
| v10 | a **UDP** socket instead | 300 | **0** |
| v7 + `--test-isolation=none` | same sockets, no per-file child | 300 | **0** |
| v9 | the identical socket work as a plain `node file.mjs` | 300 | **0** (3,300 children) |

So it needs a TCP socket, and it needs the per-file child process. It is not
`pg`, not PostgreSQL, not the fixture lock, not project code.

## Two of my own hypotheses died here, and one of them I had argued for

**Memory pressure and spawn storm: falsified.** `apps/pwa` runs 54 files
31-wide with no database and crashed 0 times in 25 runs - more fan-out than
academics-svc, no failures.

**Concurrency: falsified.** It still happens at `--test-concurrency=1`, where
exactly one file runs at a time. Normalised per child the rate is flat:

| fan-out | per-child rate |
|---|---|
| 11-wide | 0.242% |
| 4-wide | 0.182% |
| serial (1) | 0.273% |

An earlier reading of "0 failures at concurrency <= 8" over 60 runs looked
significant and was a small-sample artifact: 60 runs at a 2% rate expects about
one failure, so observing none means nothing. **A concurrency cap would have
turned the suite green and fixed nothing** - the exact shape of fix this
project has repeatedly caught elsewhere: a control that appears to work because
the thing it targets was never the cause.

## The proof: one variable, the runtime

Same machine, same session, same fixture, same fan-out:

| Node | runs | children | crashes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **v24.15.0** | 500 | 5,500 | **11** (2.2%) |
| **v24.21.0** | 500 | 5,500 | **0** |

Fisher exact one-tailed **p ~ 0.0005**. Node 22.23.2 - the version CI pins -
is also clean at **0 / 500**, which is why the guard below allows it rather
than assuming.

## Why it only ever hit the DB suites, and never CI

Only DB-backed test files open TCP sockets, so only they were exposed. And
every workflow pins `node-version: '22'`, which does not carry the defect -
which is why CI has been green throughout and the flake looked local and
unreproducible.

## The fix

`scripts/test-all.mjs` refuses to start on a Node 24 build below 24.21.0 and
prints the diagnosis with its measured evidence, rather than letting the suite
produce a misleading `'test failed'`. `engines` stays at `>=22` deliberately:
Node 22 is what CI runs and is unaffected, so a global `>=24.21.0` would
invalidate a green CI to fix a Windows-only defect CI does not have. Off
Windows the guard warns instead of refusing, because it was never measured
there.

The runner also names a crashed child for what it is: whole file, line 1:1,
`'test failed'`, empty stderr - and says so, with the workspace and the file.
The diagnosis is conditional on the runtime: on a patched Node it explicitly
says B-66 is NOT the explanation, so the next person is not sent chasing a
cause that has been excluded. Verified against a deliberately aborted child.

No retries. No concurrency cap. No test weakened. No application code touched.

## Validated

- **Minimal reproducer on 24.21.0: 1,000 runs, 11,000 children, 0 crashes**
- **Full 13-workspace suite x10 on 24.21.0: 10/10 green, 2,270 tests, 13/13
  workspaces, total stable at 2,270 every run**
- Real `academics-svc` suite on 24.21.0: 0 failures / 40 runs (1/40 on 24.15.0)
- Guard: refuses 24.15.0 (exit 1), allows 22.23.2 and 24.21.0
- Detector: names a deliberately crashed child, and declines to blame B-66 on
  a patched runtime

## Two interruptions recorded as interruptions, not as evidence

**The PostgreSQL container exited** (status 255) when the machine restarted
mid-investigation. A v6 rung recorded 181/200 "failures" that were all
`exit=1` with `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:55432` - deterministic, legible, and
nothing to do with B-66. Classified VOID; the rung was re-run against a live
database. Every experiment after that runs a preflight that refuses to start
unless the container is up and the port answers.

**A previous session's teardown** killed a control mid-run, producing
`0x40010004` (DBG_TERMINATE_PROCESS) and `0xC000026B`
(STATUS_DLL_INIT_FAILED_LOGOFF) across nine iterations. Also VOID. Only the
six clean iterations before it were kept.

## CLOSED - verified on the real system runtime (2026-09-10)

The upgrade happened. `node --version` from inside the repository now reports
**v24.21.0** (`C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe`), installed from the MSI whose
SHA-256 was checked against the release `SHASUMS256.txt` before it was run.

Every earlier number in this entry was measured against a *portable* 24.21.0.
These were re-measured against the installed one, because a fix validated only
on a binary nobody actually runs is not a validated fix:

| check | result |
|---|---|
| minimal TCP + `node --test` reproducer | **0 crashes / 500 runs (5,500 children)** |
| real `academics-svc` suite | **185 tests, 0 fail** |
| runtime guard | allows 24.21.0, no refusal |
| crashed-child detector | still names a deliberately aborted child, and says B-66 is NOT the explanation on this runtime |

Before the upgrade, the same reproducer on the same machine crashed **11 times
in 500 runs**. After it, zero in 500 - and zero in the 1,000-run portable
stress, and zero across 10 consecutive full 13-workspace suites.

**B-58 closes with this.** It was the same mechanism, first seen in
`ops-svc/branding.test.ts` at P0 checkpoint 3, and it was never a test.

## What this cost, and what it is worth remembering for

Three phases of investigation chased a defect in someone else's code, because
the symptom - a whole file failing with no assertion and no stderr - is
indistinguishable from a test that failed, and the runner had no way to say
otherwise. Four separate hypotheses were held with some confidence and all
four were wrong: an unref'd socket, memory pressure, process fan-out, and
concurrency. The last one had a p-value attached to it and was still wrong;
the sample was simply too small, and a concurrency cap would have turned the
suite green while fixing nothing.

What broke it open was refusing to accept a green run as proof, and building a
ladder where each rung differed from the last by exactly one thing. The moment
the failing fixture contained nothing but `node:net` and `node:test`, the
product was exonerated and the only remaining variable was the runtime.
