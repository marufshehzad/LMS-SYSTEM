# 11 — Master Plan: Multi-School White-Label SaaS Roadmap

**Status:** Approved plan of record — implement phase by phase, in order.
**Date:** 2026-08-29
**Supersedes:** the four "PHASE-0" documents in `~/Downloads` (46-table ERD, migration
plan, API/security spec, master summary). Those were written without auditing this
repository and describe migrating a legacy system to a new "v2" schema. **No such
migration is needed** — the live schema (38 migrations, ~100 tables, RLS-enforced
multi-tenancy) is already ahead of that ERD in every dimension. Their useful ideas
(security sign-off checklist, notification targeting matrix, print-document field list)
are folded into the phases below.

## সারসংক্ষেপ (বাংলা)

এই সিস্টেম **ইতিমধ্যে মাল্টি-টেন্যান্ট** — এক কোডবেস, অনেক স্কুল, ডাটাবেস-লেভেলে
(RLS) আইসোলেশন। ক্লাস → গ্রুপ → সেকশন → শিফট হায়ারার্কি, বছরভিত্তিক এনরোলমেন্ট
হিস্টরি, স্থায়ী স্টুডেন্ট আইডি, শিক্ষক অ্যাসাইনমেন্ট, প্রমোশন/রোলওভার, অফলাইন
অ্যাটেনডেন্স + সিংক, পরীক্ষার রুটিন, মার্কস → রেজাল্ট → GPA, ফি/ইনভয়েস — সব বানানো
এবং টেস্টেড (**৮৯০ টেস্ট পাস, ০ ফেইল** — ২০২৬-০৮-২৯ যাচাইকৃত, R-7 শেষে; এর সাথে
২১টি SQL সুইট যা সত্যিকারের PostgreSQL-এ চালিয়ে দেখা হয়েছে)। **নতুন করে ভিত্তি
বানানোর দরকার নেই।**

যা নেই, সেটাই এই প্ল্যান — অগ্রাধিকার অনুযায়ী:

1. **হোয়াইট-লেবেল ব্র্যান্ডিং** — প্রতিটা স্কুল তার নিজের নাম, লোগো, রঙ, ওয়াটারমার্ক দেখবে (আপনার ১ নম্বর দাবি)
2. **নোটিশ ও নোটিফিকেশন** — সবাই / শুধু শিক্ষক / শুধু ছাত্র / শুধু অভিভাবক / ক্লাস / সেকশন টার্গেটিং + ইন-অ্যাপ নোটিফিকেশন বেল
3. **প্রধান শিক্ষক ও আইটি পোর্টাল সম্পূর্ণ করা** — ক্লাস ৯ → সায়েন্স → F সেকশন → ৪০ ছাত্র ড্রিল-ডাউন, শিক্ষক অ্যাসাইন/রিপ্লেস UI, ইউজার ম্যানেজমেন্ট
4. **ক্যালেন্ডার UI** — ছুটি, ইভেন্ট, পরীক্ষা
5. **ব্র্যান্ডেড প্রিন্ট** — রসিদ, রিপোর্ট কার্ড, এডমিট কার্ড — স্কুলের লোগো/ওয়াটারমার্ক সহ
6. **স্টুডেন্ট সার্চ ও হিস্টরি** — ১০ বছর পরেও আইডি দিয়ে খুঁজে পাওয়া
7. **অনবোর্ডিং ও প্ল্যাটফর্ম কনসোল** — নতুন স্কুল যোগ করার উইজার্ড
8. **গো-লাইভ আনলক** — SMS এগ্রিগেটর, OTP লগইন চালু, MFS

**সফটওয়্যার নাকি ওয়েব?** — সিদ্ধান্ত: **ওয়েব + PWA** (ইতিমধ্যে বানানো)। স্কুলের পিসি/ফোনে
ইনস্টল করা যায়, নেট গেলে অফলাইনে কাজ চলে, নেট এলে সিংক হয়। আলাদা ডেস্কটপ সফটওয়্যার
বানানো হবে না — এক কোডবেস, আপডেট এক জায়গায়।

**সেকশন চ্যাট** — ইচ্ছাকৃতভাবে পরে (মডারেশন/সেফটি জটিলতা); Phase R-9-এ ঐচ্ছিক।

## 1. Decisions of record

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | **Keep the existing architecture.** Modular monolith (9 service dirs → serverless functions), Neon Postgres + RLS tenancy, framework-free PWA, IndexedDB outbox. | It works, it's tested, and it already satisfies the hardest requirements (tenancy, offline, history). Rewriting is the only way to lose. |
| D2 | **Discard the Downloads "Phase-0 / Architecture v2" migration plan.** | It assumes a legacy schema that doesn't exist. The live schema is stronger than its 46-table ERD (partitioning, RLS, envelope PII crypto, GiST clash constraints, board-rule SQL functions). |
| D3 | **Web + PWA, not desktop software.** | Already built and offline-capable. One codebase, zero install friction, instant updates. |
| D4 | **White-label via configuration, never per-school code.** Branding lives in `tenants.settings` (jsonb) + a `tenant_branding` read path; the codebase stays identical for every school. | Matches repo rule and PRD §10: no `schoolA.css`. |
| D5 | **Roles stay code-gated for now (`requireRole`/`requireStaff` + RLS).** Permission-level RBAC (`role_permissions` is seeded but unread) is deferred until a real need appears. | RLS is the actual enforcement; wiring 22 permissions now adds surface without adding safety. |
| D6 | **Notifications: in-app first, SMS as a channel of the same system.** One `notices` model fans out to in-app inbox rows + `sms_outbox` rows through the existing outbox/cron pipeline. | Reuses the built, suppression-aware SMS pipeline; SMS is ~80% of infra cost, so push/in-app first. |
| D7 | **New agent surfaces follow the Ata Ekta design system** (tokens in `apps/pwa/public/design/tokens/`). ⚠️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED IN `/app` — audited 2026-09-01.** `app.css` neither imports those tokens nor contains their values: it carries a legacy `--c-*` family (373 selectors) plus a parallel `--color-*` family whose values are Material-ish (`#e53935`), not Ata Ekta (`#D23B2E`). The commit titled *"rebuild the app on the Ata Ekta design system"* (`c93bddc`) changed 1 of 59 view modules. See the UI/UX audit entry in [PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md). | Consistency; dark mode already tokenised. |
| D8 | **Every new table gets: `tenant_id` + `app.enforce_tenant()` trigger + RLS policy + rollback file + probe in `migration-status.mjs`.** This is the existing schema-lint rule; it stays absolute. | Tenant isolation is the product. |
| D9 | Section chat, native apps, biometrics, library/transport/hostel/payroll = **post-roadmap add-ons**. | PRD "What NOT to do": don't build social features before core management is stable. |
| D10 | **[`docs/PHASE_LOG.md`](PHASE_LOG.md) is the canonical chronological implementation history.** It is updated *before* a phase may be marked complete, and after every meaningful change: a phase, a bug fix, an architectural decision, a migration, a test milestone, a deployment change, an important discovery. History is append-only — a decision that supersedes an earlier one gets a NEW entry saying what changed, why, and what replaced it; the old entry stays. | A new agent (or a new engineer) must be able to read one file and know what has happened here from the beginning, without any chat history. Chat context is lost; a file in the repository is not. Silently editing away an old decision destroys the reasoning that a future reader needs most — the reason something was tried and abandoned. |
| D11 | **`shikhonBD` is the permanent platform and marketing brand. White-labelling applies ONLY to a tenant's operational application and the documents it produces.** The public marketing site, platform documentation, and any future platform Super Admin console stay branded shikhonBD / eShikhon. A school's login, shell, PWA identity, notices, receipts and reports carry the school's identity. Enforced in both directions by the `Brand boundary (D11)` job in `.github/workflows/frontend.yml`. | R-1 removed the platform brand from tenant screens, which was correct — and created the opposite risk, because "remove ShikhonBD" reads like a rule that applies everywhere. It does not. The landing page is *our* shopfront; un-branding it would be a marketing loss nothing else would catch. The one-line statement of the rule is: **the platform is branded, the tenant application is white-labelled.** |
| D12 | **Tenant resolution: each institution gets its own entry link — never a school-picker.** Today that is the install link (`/?tid=<tenant-id>`, or the slug typed once on the login screen); the device remembers it, the PWA install bakes it into `start_url`, and the login screen renders that school's identity before anyone signs in. At R-7 each tenant additionally gets a subdomain (`monipur.shikhonbd.com`) resolved from the hostname, with custom domains as a later option. A "choose your school" dropdown is forbidden at every stage. See §1b for the full mechanism. | One deployment must serve many institutions without ever showing one school's users another school's door. A picker would enumerate our customer list to anyone who loads the login page — the same reason `app.public_branding()` answers only exact keys and returns 200-with-defaults for unknown ones. The link a school hands out is the same channel it already uses for everything else it tells its guardians. |
| D13 | **A feature is not implemented until a person can use it.** Every phase is verified across all 18 layers of §1c — database, service, API, authorization, UI, workflow, and the loading / empty / error / success states that make a screen usable, plus responsive, offline, real-time, notification, audit, test, browser-acceptance and PHASE_LOG coverage where each applies. Any Master Plan requirement describing something a principal, teacher, student, guardian or IT admin is expected to *use* must have a usable UI unless it is explicitly marked backend-only. Where a capability exists but its screen does not, it is reported as **"Backend complete — UI pending"** — never as complete. | The failure this prevents is specific and had already happened here: R-2 finalisation made the notice-SMS cap tenant-configurable, tested it, documented it — and left no way to configure it except writing SQL by hand. A setting only a developer can reach is a setting a school does not have. The same shape recurs whenever a phase is judged by its migration and its test count, because those are the parts that are easy to count. A school does not experience a table or an endpoint; it experiences a screen, and a screen that has no empty state is broken on its first day, when everything is empty. |
| D14 | **Ata Ekta is the canonical visual direction for the functional `/app`.** `/design` remains a visual reference and prototype — it is not the production application and is not promoted into one. The integration is token-first, then shell, then screens by role, preserving every existing capability: real APIs, the permission model, tenant context, the offline outbox, dark mode and all UX states. `/app` must end with a **genuinely desktop** desktop (persistent sidebar, real tables) and a **genuinely mobile** mobile (bottom navigation, lists, sheets, no stretched tables) — not one layout shrunk into the other. Full roadmap: [UI-UX-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md](UI-UX-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md). **P0 delivered 2026-09-01** — canonical palette, Muslin ground, semantic type names on the Bangla-tuned ladder, and a warm Ata Ekta dark palette, all by re-pointing a 29-token alias layer in one file. | The 2026-09-01 audit found three generations of interface and D7 unimplemented: `app.css` carries neither the Ata Ekta tokens nor their values, and the commit that claimed to rebuild the app on them changed 1 of 59 view modules. The prototype meanwhile holds 32 desktop/mobile pairs that were never wired to anything. Deciding this explicitly stops the two surfaces drifting further apart, and stops the prototype being mistaken for the product. |
| D15 | **The product has five surfaces, each with one address, one brand and one audience.** `/` public marketing (**shikhonBD**) · `/demo` a safe isolated demo (**new route**) · `<slug>.sikhon.systems` the tenant application with `/app?tid=` kept as the backward-compatible door (**school-branded**) · `platform.sikhon.systems` the Platform Console with `/platform` kept as compatibility (**shikhonBD, never white-labelled, Super Admin only**) · `/design` a development reference that is never a customer destination. The tenant application stays **one** application with role-scoped navigation derived from the existing server permission model — never five sites and never a school-picker. Full specification: [FINAL-PRODUCT-SURFACE-ARCHITECTURE.md](FINAL-PRODUCT-SURFACE-ARCHITECTURE.md). | The surfaces existed but had never been written down together, and two gaps followed from that. The free-demo CTA points at `/app`, which falls into demo mode implicitly whenever nobody is logged in — so a real teacher who is merely logged out sees fabricated students under their own school's door. And the operator console shares an origin with the marketing site, which is the one surface that should be hardest to find. Naming the five surfaces fixes both by construction, and costs nothing to adopt: `tenantKeyFromHost()` is already domain-agnostic and already reserves `platform`, so the preferred doors need DNS and a proxy block, not code. |
| D16 | **The Platform Console owns the commercial relationship with every institution — subscription, payment record, entitlement and lifecycle — and it is operated by hand, not by a gateway.** Each tenant carries a plan, a billing cycle, a price, a student cap, a set of enabled modules, a start date and a next-due date. A platform operator records payments manually (amount, date, method, reference, note) and the tenant's access state is **re-evaluated from that record**, never set by hand as a free-form field: `active → payment_due → grace_period → limited → suspended`, and back to `active` when a payment closes the balance. **Suspension is an access state, never a data operation** — no deletion, no anonymisation, no export block, reversible by one platform action (R-7.11, unchanged and now load-bearing). Every commercial act writes `audit.platform_access` in the same transaction as the act. No tenant role — principal, IT admin, teacher, student, guardian — can read or write any of it. **This supersedes R-7.10's “Billing the schools is out of scope”**, which stands as written for R-7 and is superseded from R-7 onward. It does **not** authorise an online payment gateway: manual recording is the whole of the requirement at this business stage, and a gateway is a separate, separately-approved phase. **Implementation belongs to P7 (Platform Console); P2–P6 must not build it.** | R-7 was right that we could not integrate a payment gateway before having customers, and wrong to read that as “no commercial model in the product”. The two are different: the gateway is an integration, the commercial state is a *fact about a school* that the product already half-stores. `tenants` has carried `plan_code`, `student_cap`, `trial_ends_on` and `status` since migration 001, and `features jsonb` has sat unread since then — so the operator can already suspend a school but cannot say why, cannot record that it paid, and cannot tell a school two days late from one three months gone. Without a payment record the lifecycle has no input, so suspension becomes a judgement somebody makes in a spreadsheet and applies by hand — which is exactly the state where a paying school gets locked out and an unpaying one does not. Recording the requirement now, and placing it in P7, stops it being invented ad hoc inside a UI phase. |
| D17 | **The repository documentation must tell the project's whole story, and it is updated before a phase may be called complete.** Every phase, sub-phase, bug fix, architectural decision, security finding, UI migration, database migration, deployment change, environment change, test milestone, owner decision, important limitation and backlog reclassification is recorded. **Nine canonical documents** carry it, each with one job and no duplicates: [00-START-HERE.md](00-START-HERE.md) the handoff router · [11-MASTER-PLAN.md](11-MASTER-PLAN.md) the approved roadmap and the decisions of record · [PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md) the append-only chronological history · [07-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md](07-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md) the current snapshot, carrying **no stale numbers** · [UI-UX-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md](UI-UX-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md) the D13/D14 UI state per phase · [FINAL-PRODUCT-SURFACE-ARCHITECTURE.md](FINAL-PRODUCT-SURFACE-ARCHITECTURE.md) the five surfaces · [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) the single backlog, one ID per item · [12-PRODUCTION-RUNBOOK.md](12-PRODUCTION-RUNBOOK.md) and [PILOT-ONBOARDING-RUNBOOK.md](PILOT-ONBOARDING-RUNBOOK.md) the operational procedures · [FINAL-FULL-PROJECT-AUDIT-PLAN.md](FINAL-FULL-PROJECT-AUDIT-PLAN.md) how the final audit is run. **Three sub-rules are absolute.** *(a) Evidence is labelled, never inflated* — OBSERVED / TESTED / REHEARSED / INFERRED / PLANNED / BLOCKED / UNTESTED are different words and a rehearsal never becomes a pass. A gate that was not run is written `NOT RUN`. Test totals are read off an actual run, never remembered. *(b) Drift is disclosed, never hidden* — where the deployed system differs from the blueprint, both are stated with the reason and the security implication, and they stay stated until the blueprint is reconciled. *(c) Accuracy outranks completeness* — NOT BUILT, PARTIAL, BLOCKED and EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY are acceptable answers; making a row look finished is not. This **extends D10** (which bound only `PHASE_LOG.md`) to the whole documentation set; D10 stands unchanged and is not superseded. Owner instruction, 2026-09-01. | A phase's real output is not the code — the code is recoverable from the code. It is the *reasoning*: which of two designs was chosen, what the third attempt proved, why a capability that looks missing was deliberately not built. That lives in chat context, and chat context is destroyed at the end of every session. This project has already paid for that twice: a decision recorded as “rebuild the app on the Ata Ekta design system” had changed 1 view module of 59 and nobody could tell for months, and a type-check stayed red across six commits because the gate's result was assumed rather than read. Both are the same failure — a claim in a document that no longer matched the repository. The rule that prevents it is not “write more documentation” but “the document must be falsifiable and must be checked”, which is why (a) and (c) matter more than volume. |

## 1a. Surfaces — which brand belongs where (D11)

Three distinct surfaces, and confusing them is the failure mode D11 exists to
prevent:

```text
PUBLIC PLATFORM                          TENANT APPLICATION
  shikhonBD / eShikhon                     school-a.<platform>
  ├── landing / marketing site             college-b.<platform>
  ├── pricing, public docs, SEO            ├── login          ─┐
  ├── platform Super Admin console         ├── shell / PWA     │ the
  └── company communications               ├── notices         │ school's
       → BRANDED shikhonBD                 ├── receipts        │ identity
                                           └── reports        ─┘
                                                → WHITE-LABELLED
```

The marketing site sells the platform; the application runs a school. A school's
staff, students and guardians spend their year inside the right-hand column and
should see their own institution there. Anyone evaluating the product is in the
left-hand column and should see ours.

Platform attribution inside a tenant application is not forbidden, but it is a
deliberate design decision (a discreet footer, say) — not something that arrives
by a string nobody removed.

**Current state — resolved (R-1-A, 2026-08-29).** The three surfaces now live at
three addresses, Option B of the three set out in [PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md):

| Address | File | Surface | Brand |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | `apps/pwa/public/index.html` | shikhonBD marketing site | **platform** |
| `/app` | `apps/pwa/public/app.html` | the tenant application | white-labelled |
| `/design` | `apps/pwa/public/design.html` | the Ata Ekta prototype | white-labelled |

**UI status (audited 2026-09-01).** `/design` is a **mockup** — 66 screens (32 desktop/mobile pairs, a `.dnav` desktop sidebar, a `.bottomnav` phone shell), one `fetch` in the whole file, no app boot. `/app` is the functional product but is **mobile-first at every width**: its only desktop breakpoint styles the branding editor. The polished desktop/mobile layouts the prototype holds have never been connected to functionality. Recommendation on record: **integrate `/design`'s visual system into `/app`**, preserving `/app`'s dark mode and UX states, and designing the ~4 screen families the prototype never covered. No redesign authorised yet.

Routed identically on both hosts (`vercel.json` rewrites, `netlify.toml`
redirects declared before the catch-all). The service worker treats only
`/app*` navigations as the application, so it never answers the marketing site
with the app's HTML; `PRECACHE` and the offline fallback point at `/app`; the
web manifest installs with `start_url` and `scope` of `/app`.

---

## 1b. One deployment, many institutions — how a school reaches ITS door, and why it can never open another's (D12)

The owner's question, stated plainly: *there is one server and one login page —
so how do Monipur High School's people log into Monipur, Mohammadpur's into
Mohammadpur, with each school's admins, teachers, students, guardians, data and
rules completely separate?* Everything below is **already built and tested**;
this section exists so the mechanism is written down rather than implied.

### How a user reaches their own school's login

```text
The school hands out ITS link            The device from then on
──────────────────────────────           ───────────────────────────
shikhonbd…/?tid=<monipur-id>      →      remembers the tenant (localStorage),
  (printed on the admission slip,        shows MONIPUR's name/logo/colours on
   sent in the school's SMS, QR          the login screen BEFORE sign-in (R-1),
   on the office wall)                   installs the PWA as "Monipur High"
                                         (start_url carries ?tid=)
```

- **No link?** The login screen asks once for the school ID (slug) — a fallback,
  not the main road.
- **R-7 adds subdomains**: `monipur.shikhonbd.com`, tenant resolved from the
  hostname; optional custom domains later. The `?tid=` link keeps working.
- **Never a school-picker dropdown** (D12): it would enumerate the customer
  list, and `app.public_branding()` is deliberately built so that enumeration is
  impossible — exact key in, one school out, nothing for an unknown key.

### Why crossing tenants is impossible, not just forbidden

Four layers, each independent of the one above it; the bottom one is the actual
guarantee:

```text
L1  IDENTITY   users are tenant-scoped rows. A Monipur teacher's account IS a
               Monipur row; phone+OTP verifies within that tenant; the JWT
               carries tid, EdDSA-signed — unforgeable, 15-minute life.
L2  API        no endpoint accepts a tenant id in URL or body. The only tenant
               a request can name is the one in its verified token. There is
               no parameter to tamper with.
L3  SESSION    every DB transaction starts with SET LOCAL app.tenant_id from
               the token (packages/server-core withTenant()).
L4  DATABASE   Row-Level Security on every tenant table (~95), FORCE'd, fail-
               closed: Mohammadpur's rows are invisible to a Monipur session
               at the database layer. A bug in L1–L3 yields zero rows, not
               another school's data. No context at all → zero rows.
```

Beneath even L4: the app's runtime DB role cannot BYPASSRLS (boot guard refuses
to start), and each tenant's PII is encrypted under **its own key**
(`tenants.dek_wrapped`) — school A's identifiers cannot be decrypted with school
B's key even if rows somehow leaked. Per-tenant SMS caps, AI budgets and rate
limits keep one school's usage from affecting another's.

**Inside** a school, the same L4 narrows further by role (the RESTRICTIVE
policies of migration 010): a student reads only their own records, a guardian
only their linked children (`guardianships`), a teacher only their assigned
sections, the principal the whole institution — *their* institution.

### The people, concretely

- Monipur's admin, headmaster, teachers, students, guardians are all rows with
  Monipur's `tenant_id`; their roles (`user_roles`) are tenant-scoped too. The
  headmaster of Monipur holds `principal` **in Monipur** — the word grants
  nothing anywhere else.
- One person serving two institutions (an examiner, a guardian with children in
  two schools) has **two accounts**, one per school, joined internally by the
  permanent `global_person_id`; they enter each school through that school's own
  link. No screen ever merges two schools' data.
- Every school's own rules — weekend days, shifts, grading bands, fee
  structures, calendar, subject sets, branding — are that school's rows,
  isolated the same way as its people.

### Proof, not promise

CI's tenancy suite (and R-1's `db/tests/tenant_branding.sql`) asserts it
directly: with school A's session context, `SELECT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` against
school B match **zero rows**, and a session with no tenant context sees nothing
at all. Every new table is required to join this regime (D8) and the schema-lint
test fails CI if one ships without RLS.

---

## 1c. Definition of done, layer by layer (D13)

A phase is complete when every applicable layer below is done **and verified**, not
when the migration applies and the tests are green. Layers that genuinely do not
apply are marked *n/a with a reason* — "n/a" alone is not an answer.

| # | Layer | What "done" means |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Database / migration | Forward + rollback, RLS, `tenant_id`, probe in `migration-status.mjs` (D8) |
| 2 | Backend / service logic | The rule lives in one place, not copied per caller |
| 3 | API | Routed, role-gated, shaped for the screen that consumes it |
| 4 | Authorization / tenant isolation | Enforced server-side and by RLS — never by hiding a button |
| 5 | **Frontend UI** | A real screen a real person reaches by navigating, not by typing a URL |
| 6 | User workflow / UX | The whole path end to end, including how someone backs out of it |
| 7 | Loading state | What the screen shows on a 2G connection before the data lands |
| 8 | Empty state | **What it shows on day one, when the school has no data at all** |
| 9 | Error state | What it shows when the request fails, in Bangla, saying what to do |
| 10 | Success state | Visible confirmation that the thing happened |
| 11 | Responsive behaviour | Usable on the ৳8,000 Android phone most teachers actually carry |
| 12 | Offline behaviour | Where promised: works offline, queues, and *says* it queued |
| 13 | Real-time behaviour | Where promised — and where not promised, the UI must not imply it |
| 14 | Notifications | Where the workflow should tell somebody something happened |
| 15 | Audit / history | Where a school may later need to prove what was done, by whom |
| 16 | Tests | Backend **and** UI, in the same commit as the feature |
| 17 | Browser acceptance test | For every important workflow, driven through the real UI |
| 18 | Documentation / PHASE_LOG | Written *before* the phase is called complete (D10) |

### The UI-first rule

If the Master Plan describes something a school administrator, principal, teacher,
student or guardian is expected to use, it needs a usable screen. Not an endpoint
plus an intention.

| Requirement | The screen it owes |
|---|---|
| Teacher assignment | assignment UI |
| Teacher replacement | replacement UI |
| Student promotion | promotion workflow UI |
| Notice targeting | audience picker UI |
| Notification | bell / inbox UI |
| SMS settings | admin settings UI, wherever configuration is expected |
| Branding | branding editor |
| Calendar | calendar UI |
| Search / history | search + student history UI |
| School onboarding | complete setup wizard |
| Reports | report UI with an export / print workflow |
| Fees | fee, payment and receipt UI |

The only exception is a requirement explicitly marked **backend-only** or
**infrastructure-only** in this plan. Marking one that way is a decision that gets
written down with its reason, not a default.

### No backend-only claim

Where the capability exists and the workflow does not, the phase report says:

> **Backend complete — UI pending.**

It does not say complete, done, or shipped. This is not pessimism about the work;
it is an accurate statement of what a school can currently do with it.

### Acceptance criteria

Every major feature is exercised end to end, through the interface a person uses:

```text
User → UI → API → Authorization → Database → Result → UI feedback
```

Multi-tenant features are additionally proven from both sides of the wall:

```text
Tenant A                    → correct UI and data
Tenant B                    → different UI and data
Tenant A reaching for B     → blocked
```

Offline-capable features are proven through the whole cycle, including what the
screen tells the user at each stage:

```text
Online      → action
Offline     → the action still works where we promised it would
Reconnect   → it syncs
UI          → shows the correct sync status throughout
```

### Phase reporting format

Every phase report separates the layers, so that a gap is visible rather than
averaged away by the ones that went well:

```text
Backend implemented        …
API implemented            …
UI implemented             …
UX tested                  …
Security tested            …
Tenant isolation tested    …
Offline tested             …
Real-time tested           …
Browser acceptance tested  …
```

If any applicable layer is missing, the phase is not described as fully complete.

## 2. What already exists (do NOT rebuild)

Verified against the repo 2026-08-29 (full audit in §6 of the audit report; summary here so
no phase accidentally re-implements these):

- **Multi-tenancy** — `tenants` root, `tenant_id` on ~95 tables, `app.enforce_tenant()`,
  generated RLS on every table, `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, boot-time `assertRlsEnforced()`.
- **Academic hierarchy** — `classes` (level 1–12, `stream`, academic `group`
  science/humanities/business), `sections` (class × year × name × shift, capacity,
  `class_teacher_id`), `subjects`/`subject_papers`/`class_subjects` (NCTB mark split),
  per-student resolved subject sets (`student_subjects`, `app.derive_student_subjects()`).
- **Permanent identity & history** — `users.global_person_id` (immutable, lifetime),
  `student_profiles.student_code`, one `enrolments` row per student per year
  (roll, status, dates) — the "10 years later" requirement is already modeled.
- **Year lifecycle** — `academic_years.is_current`, `year_rollovers`,
  `app.rollover_preview()` / `app.commit_rollover()` (promote/detain/graduate with
  per-student Bangla blockers).
- **Teacher assignment** — `section_subject_teachers` (section × subject × teacher × year),
  `sections.class_teacher_id`, competencies/expertise tables. (Replacement **UI** is a gap — Phase R-3.)
- **Guardians** — `guardianships` M:N (`is_primary`, `receives_sms`, `can_pay_fees`),
  `/academics/ward` single-response guardian home, guardian dashboard view.
- **Attendance + offline** — partitioned `attendance_records`, corrections (append-only),
  30-second grid UX, IndexedDB outbox with zero-loss contract, Background Sync,
  per-entity conflict policy. Offline login persistence via 30-day refresh tokens.
- **Exams** — component-wise marks (CQ/MCQ/practical/CA), publish = grade→GPA→rank→lock
  in one transaction, immutable after publish, `mark_corrections` with approval,
  exam routine with student-clash gate, seat plan, invigilation.
- **Timetable/RMS** — versioned routines, GiST exclusion constraints (double-booking
  structurally impossible), solver, editor UI, substitution finder with ranked candidates.
- **Finance** — fee heads/structures/waivers, invoice generation (idempotent per
  student+period), MFS webhook skeleton, double-entry ledger with balance assertion,
  digital receipts — printable on the school's letterhead since R-5 (HTML + browser
  Save-as-PDF; no stored artifact, because object storage is still stubbed).
- **Import** — CSV wizard with dry-run → digest → commit (`/academics/import`,
  `import-view.ts`). Export is the gap.
- **Provisioning** — `app.provision_tenant()` seeds year/terms/grading/classes/sections/
  subjects/bell-schedule/fee-heads/chart-of-accounts in one call. UI is the gap — Phase R-7.
- **Security** — EdDSA JWT (15 min) + rotating refresh (30 d, reuse detection), argon2id,
  Postgres token-bucket rate limiting on every endpoint, AES-256-GCM envelope PII
  encryption + blind indexes, PDPA-grade `audit.pii_access`.
- **AI** — SikhokAI (teacher co-pilot) + ShikhoAI (Socratic tutor), PII redaction,
  session audit, budget tables. Dark until `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- **SMS pipeline** — event → suppression (grace window, holidays, caps, consent) →
  `sms_outbox` (dedupe, segments, cost) → cron drain → **provider adapter** (R-8) →
  **DLR webhook** writes `delivered_at`/`cost_bdt`. The stub remains the default
  until an aggregator contract lands; the seam it plugs into now exists.

## 4. The roadmap

Phases are numbered **R-1 … R-9** (R = rollout, to avoid colliding with the old PRD's
Phase 0–4). Each phase is independently shippable, ordered by (a) owner priority,
(b) dependency, (c) daily-habit-before-quarterly. **Definition of done for every phase**
is `05-DELIVERY-ROADMAP.md` §7 — migrations forward+rollback in CI, tenancy suite green,
RLS on every new table, tests in the same commit, `bn`+`en` strings, bundle gate, and a
docs/07 status update — plus two additions that are not optional:

- **A [PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md) entry, written before the phase is called complete**
  (D10). Not after, and not "when there's time": the entry is part of the work.
- **The `Brand boundary (D11)` CI job green in both directions** — no platform brand on
  tenant surfaces, and the platform brand still present on the marketing site.
- **Every applicable layer of §1c green (D13)** — including the UI, its empty state, and
  a browser acceptance test for each important workflow. A phase with a working endpoint
  and no screen is reported as *Backend complete — UI pending*, not as done.

### R-0 — Hygiene (½ day, do first)

- Add `.gitattributes` (`api/v1/**/*.js text eol=lf`, sensibly cover `netlify/`), run
  `git add --renormalize .` — kills the permanent 10-file phantom dirty state on Windows.
- Update stale counts in `docs/07` (38 migrations, not 23).
- Decide nothing else here; this phase exists so every later diff is clean.

### R-1 — White-label & branding foundation *(owner priority #1)* — **DONE**

> Shipped 2026-08-29. What was built, where it lives, and its known limitations
> are recorded in [07-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md](07-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md) §9b.
> Two deviations from the plan below, both deliberate: branding is keyed by slug
> **or tenant id** (the install link carries the id), and the served `index.html`
> mock-up got its own inline branding bootstrap rather than being restructured.

**Goal:** a school sees only its own identity — app shell, login, PWA install, and a
reusable branded print header — with zero per-school code.

- **DB (migration 039):** define the canonical branding keys inside `tenants.settings`
  jsonb (no new table needed): `branding.name_bn/name_en/short_name, logo_url,
  favicon_url, primary_color, accent_color, address, phone, email, website,
  watermark_url, headmaster_name, headmaster_signature_url, established_year, motto_bn`.
  A `CHECK`-free jsonb contract documented + validated in code (zod-style validator in
  `server-core`). Seed sensible defaults from existing tenant columns (`name_bn`, `eiin`).
- **API:** `GET /api/v1/ops/branding` (authenticated, returns the tenant's branding —
  cacheable, also served pre-auth by tenant slug for the login screen) and
  `PUT /api/v1/ops/branding` (IT-admin/principal only, audited).
- **Asset storage:** logo/watermark/signature upload — small images, stored as data-URLs
  in settings initially (≤64 KB each, validated); object storage comes later with answer
  scripts. This avoids standing up a bucket for Phase R-1.
- **PWA:** `app.ts` boot loads branding by tenant (`?tid=`/localStorage slug) → sets
  document title, header name, logo, and CSS custom properties (`--color-primary` etc. —
  the Ata Ekta tokens are already custom properties, so theming is a style-attribute
  write). Login screen shows the school's name+logo instead of hardcoded `ShikhonBD`.
  Dynamic manifest: a tiny function serving `manifest.webmanifest` per tenant
  (name, theme_color, icons) so "install the app" installs *their school's* app.
- **Print foundation:** one shared `branded-doc.ts` in `ui-core` — school header
  (logo, name, address, EIIN), footer, watermark layer, signature block — consumed by
  every later printed document. Print stylesheet (`@media print`) added to `app.css`.
- **IT screen:** branding editor page (preview live).
- **Tests:** branding validator unit tests; branding API integration test proving tenant
  A can never read/write tenant B's branding (RLS suite extension); PWA boot test that
  hardcoded brand strings are gone (grep-gate in CI like `check-secrets.mjs`).

**Exit:** two demo tenants side by side show different names, logos, colors on login,
shell, and a sample printed page — same deployment, same code.

### R-2 — Notices & notification system *(owner priority #2)*

**Goal:** প্রধান শিক্ষক একটা নোটিশ দিলে টার্গেট অনুযায়ী সবার নোটিফিকেশন বেলে পৌঁছাবে —
এবং চাইলে গার্ডিয়ানের ফোনে SMS।

- **DB (migration 040):** `notices` (tenant, title, body, category
  general/teacher/student/guardian/class/section/exam/fee/emergency, audience jsonb
  {type: all|staff|students|guardians|class|section|users, ids[]}, channels
  {inapp, sms}, publish_at, published_by, status draft/published/archived) +
  `notice_receipts` (notice × user, delivered_at, read_at — the in-app inbox row,
  partitioned if volume demands later; start unpartitioned). RLS: recipients see only
  their receipts; authors principal/IT (+ teacher for own-section notices, flag-gated).
- **Fan-out:** on publish, resolve the audience server-side (staff roster / enrolments /
  guardianships) → bulk-insert receipts → emit `notice.published.v1` into the existing
  `event_outbox`. The SMS stage of `sms-svc` picks it up exactly like absence events
  (template, dedupe, caps, consent, holiday suppression) — **no new SMS pipeline.**
- **API:** `POST/GET /api/v1/ops/notices` (author side, role-gated),
  `GET /api/v1/ops/inbox` (+ unread count), `POST .../inbox/read`.
- **Sync:** add `notice_receipt` to the pull whitelist so the bell works offline-cached.
- **PWA:** notification bell + unread badge in the top bar of *every* role's shell;
  inbox view; notice composer for principal/IT (audience picker: everyone / teachers /
  students / guardians / class → group → section drill-down); notice card on the
  guardian ward view (the card `ward.ts` explicitly notes as "not built").
- **Auto-notices (same machinery, no new UI) — BUILT:** all three go through one
  `app.emit_auto_notice()`, idempotent on a partial unique index over
  `(tenant_id, source_kind, source_ref)`, in the same transaction as the event they
  announce. Exam routine published → students + guardians of the sections with a paper
  in it (`exam_routine`/examId); results published → the same people, **no marks in the
  notice** (`result`/examId); invoices generated → the new `guardians_payers` audience,
  which honours `can_pay_fees` (`invoice`/md5(period)).
- **Tests:** audience-resolution unit tests (the matrix: all/staff/class/section/
  student→their guardians); RLS test that a student never sees a teachers-only notice;
  fan-out idempotency (re-publish doesn't duplicate receipts or SMS).

- **Scheduling:** `scheduled` is a real `notice_status`, not a draft with a date.
  `app.publish_due_notices()` is swept by the **existing** ops/maintenance cron —
  no scheduler, no queue, no new process — with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` so two
  overlapping runs cannot double-emit the SMS event. The granularity is the cron's,
  and the composer says so instead of implying a precision it does not have.
- **SMS length:** 180 characters is the default and the recommendation, **not** a
  technical limit. A tenant may set `settings->'sms'->>'noticeMaxChars'` between 70
  (one Bangla segment) and a 480 hard ceiling; the composer shows the live
  per-recipient segment count before publishing. SMS stays a short alert — the full
  notice lives in the app — and every message is signed with the institution's name,
  never the platform's (D11).

**Exit:** principal publishes "শুধু শিক্ষকদের জন্য" notice → every teacher's bell rings,
no student sees it; absence + notice SMS rows queue correctly (send still stubbed until R-8).

**Status: DONE** (2026-08-29). 661 tests, 0 failing; `db/tests/notices.sql` 13/13 and
every other SQL suite executed against a real PostgreSQL 16. See `docs/PHASE_LOG.md`
entries R-2 and R-2-FINAL.

### R-3 — Principal & IT admin portals completed

**Goal:** স্কুল নিজে নিজের সব কাঠামো চালাতে পারে — ডেভেলপার ছাড়া।

- **Principal dashboard (F-1504):** institution overview — students/teachers/sections
  counts, today's attendance %, absent list, pending items (unpublished marks, unassigned
  sections), recent notices. Single aggregate endpoint (one query round-trip, like `ward`).
- **Hierarchy drill-down:** ক্লাস ৯ → [Science/Arts/Commerce] → sections → section page
  (class teacher, subject teachers, roster of 40, attendance summary). Read endpoints
  mostly exist (`sections`, `roster`); add the class/group grouping endpoint + views.
- **Teacher assignment UI:** the §32-style screen — pick year/class/group/section →
  assign class teacher + per-subject teachers (writes `section_subject_teachers` /
  `sections.class_teacher_id`); **replacement flow** = end old row (`ended_on`), insert
  new — never delete; assignment history visible per teacher and per section.
- **User management (IT):** create staff/student/guardian accounts, link guardianships,
  reset via activation codes (F-202 exists), deactivate; student→section assignment +
  roll generation screen (bulk, building on the import wizard).
- **Rollover UI:** surface `rollover_preview()` / `commit_rollover()` — the yearly
  promotion screen with per-student promote/detain/blocker list (SQL is done; this is
  a form + two endpoints).
- **Audit-log writes:** start writing `audit.activity_log` from the mutating endpoints
  touched in this phase (assignment changes, user creation, rollover commit) via one
  `server-core` helper; a minimal audit viewer under the IT menu (F-1603).
- **Tests:** assignment-history invariant (replacement never deletes), role-gate tests
  (teacher cannot open assignment editor), rollover UI end-to-end against the SQL
  functions' existing suites.

**Exit:** a school IT person, alone, can: create a teacher, assign them to Class 9
Science F for the year, replace them mid-year with history intact, promote the whole
school at year end — all from the UI.

**Status: DONE** (2026-08-29), the first phase under D13. Migration **041** gave
subject-teacher assignments a validity period and class teachers a history table, so
replacement closes a row instead of overwriting one; it also created the `it_admin`
role, which the codebase had checked for since R-1 without it existing in the roles
table. 8 API routes and 7 screens, no new Vercel functions and no new UI framework.
All four of D13's "Backend complete — UI pending" capabilities are closed — result
publishing, invoice generation and the notice-SMS cap now have callers, and the
routine-solver discrepancy was investigated and documented rather than changed
(`/rms/generation` reads a produced routine, `/rms/solve` produces one; they are
not duplicates, and `solve` stays API-only rather than gaining a second entry
point). 709 tests, 0 failing; `db/tests/assignment_history.sql` 13/13.

**The R-3 completion pass (2026-08-29) closed all three of those gaps:** creating
academic years, classes and sections from the UI; guardian linking with relationship,
SMS and `can_pay_fees`; and F-1603's audit viewer with filters, a changed-fields-only
diff and server-side redaction.

Building them exposed a real authorization gap underneath: `classes`, `sections` and
`guardianships` had complete tenant isolation and **no role scope**, so any session in
a school could have created a class or changed who pays a child's fees. Migration
**042** adds the RESTRICTIVE write policies they had always lacked; of twenty SQL
suites exactly one noticed, which is the measure of how unexercised that path was.

R-3 is now fully complete: 738 tests, 0 failing; 20 SQL suites; nothing in the phase
is "Backend complete — UI pending". Remaining adjacent gaps — editing an existing
class or section, and an audit export — are listed in `docs/PHASE_LOG.md`
R-3-COMPLETION.

### R-4 — Calendar & schedule surfacing

- **API:** `GET/POST /api/v1/academics/calendar` over the existing `calendar_days`
  (holidays, events, exams, ramadan schedule; IT/principal write, everyone reads).
- **PWA:** month-view calendar (Bangla-first) available to every role; upcoming
  holidays/exams cards on the dashboards; exam routine already renders — link it in.
- Calendar changes emit notices (R-2 machinery) when flagged "notify".
- Attendance/SMS suppression already reads `calendar_days` — now the same data is
  what users see, one source of truth.

**Exit:** each school maintains its own calendar; ছুটি/ইভেন্ট সব পোর্টালে দেখা যায়।

**Status: DONE** (2026-08-29). No new table: `calendar_days` has existed since
migration 003 and was already load-bearing (sms-svc reads it to suppress holiday
SMS). Migration **043** added `description_bn`, relaxed the UNIQUE so two events can
share a day, and — the important part — added the RESTRICTIVE write scope the table
had always lacked, under which **any student could have declared a holiday and
silenced the day's attendance SMS**. That is the third phase running where adding a
screen revealed an unscoped table; 010's loop gives every tenant table isolation and
leaves role scope to whoever builds the feature, so any table the product only ever
READ is still unscoped. R-5 should check first.

Exams are merged from `exams` and `exam_subjects` at read time and marked
non-editable, so there is one source of truth for when a paper is. The weekend comes
from `tenants.weekend_days` — Monipur {5,6}, a Madrasah {5} — and nothing hardcodes
Friday. Notices reuse `app.emit_auto_notice`; `notices.source_kind` gained
'calendar' as one deliberate value.

Reads are offline-readable (service-worker SWR, like the inbox); writes are
online-only by decision, not omission — a queued holiday is one that suppresses SMS
on a day nobody agreed to. No real-time push: there is no such infrastructure to
reuse and R-2 made the same call.

**R-4.1** (2026-08-29) closed the phase's one open owner decision. A
`working_weekend` row now genuinely overrides the weekly weekend: a school working a
make-up Saturday after a flood gets its attendance and notice SMS, where before the
register was taken and the messages were silently dropped as 'weekend'. **No
migration** — the kind, the write scope and the index all already existed. The
suppression logic had been duplicated across two senders and is now one exported,
purely-testable function; holiday still beats working weekend on a contradictory
date, because sending nine hundred SMS on a day the school is shut is the worse
error. Nothing blocked attendance before or after: that path never consulted the
calendar. 787 tests, 0 failing; `db/tests/calendar.sql` 22/22.

### R-5 — Branded print & document engine *(completes owner priority #1)*

**Goal:** every printed/PDF output carries the institution's identity via the R-1
`branded-doc` foundation. Print-first (browser `window.print()` + print CSS) —
server-side PDF only where a stored artifact is required (receipts already have
`pdf_object_key` waiting).

Documents, in order of daily-habit frequency:
1. **Fee receipt** (print view over existing `payment_receipts`; number, lines, waiver,
   signature, watermark)
2. **Report card / mark sheet** (over `exam_results` — the roadmap's Phase-2 leftover)
3. **Admit card** (exam × student, seat/room from `exam_seats`)
4. **Student ID card** (photo, `student_code`, class/section, validity)
5. **Testimonial / Transfer Certificate** (templated letter over enrolment history)
6. **Section roster / attendance sheet** (blank grid for paper fallback)

- Object storage decision lands here (needed for stored receipt PDFs + student photos):
  S3-compatible bucket, metadata in DB per `01-ARCHITECTURE`.
- **Export:** CSV export endpoints (students, attendance range, marks, dues) — `toCsv()`
  exists; respect RLS + role gates.
- **Tests:** golden-file tests for document HTML (per-tenant branding injected);
  receipt-number uniqueness already DB-enforced.

**Exit:** a guardian pays; the office prints a receipt with the school's logo,
watermark and signature. Term ends; report cards print for a whole section in one go.

**Status: DONE** (2026-08-29) for the six documents and the exit criterion; **two
bullets above are explicitly deferred, not delivered** — see below.

All six documents ship, built by pure functions in `packages/ui-core/src/documents.ts`
and rendered by ONE reusable renderer: R-1's single-page `brandedDocument` was
refactored into `docSection()` + `brandedDocumentSet()`, so one page and forty travel
the same path and R-1's thirteen tests still pass. `GET /api/v1/ops/document` serves
them and `#/documents` is the screen. Bulk generation for a whole section is one
request returning one document of N pages.

Branding is read from R-1's `tenants.settings->'branding'` inside `withTenant()` —
**no second branding table, and no tenantId anywhere in the request**, so rendering on
another school's letterhead is not something the API can express.

The plan's warning one section up ("R-5 should check first") paid off, though not
where expected. `calendar_days` was the previous phase's unscoped table; here the
gap was the opposite shape — `users_scope` is scoped, but ends with
`OR app.is_staff()` for the staff directory, so **a subject teacher could print a
letterheaded admit card or ID card for any child in the school**. The document
surface is now deliberately tighter than the directory surface:
`AND app.can_see_student(u.id)` in `loadStudents`, and a 403 rather than an empty
grid for another section's attendance sheet.

**Deferred from this phase, deliberately:**

- **Object storage did NOT land.** The bucket is still stubbed, as it is for OTP and
  MFS, so `payment_receipts.pdf_object_key` and `student_profiles.photo_key` stay
  NULL. The engine is print-first HTML — the browser's own Save-as-PDF makes the
  file, and when the credential arrives this endpoint's markup is what gets rendered
  server-side unchanged. The ID card therefore prints a labelled photo frame, not a
  broken image.
- **CSV export endpoints were NOT built.** `toCsv()` still exists unused. They are
  a different feature that happened to share a phase number; nothing in R-5 depends
  on them and nothing built here blocks them.

Full detail, including the two Windows tooling faults that had the test runner
silently executing zero tests, is in the R-5 entry of [PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md).

### R-6 — Student history & global search

- **API:** `GET /api/v1/academics/students/search` — by `student_code`, name (Bangla
  trigram index exists), phone, roll+section, guardian phone; includes
  `lifecycle_status` filter (alumni included). Staff-gated.
- **Student profile page:** tabs — profile / enrolment history (year→class→section→roll
  timeline from `enrolments`) / attendance summary / results history / fees / documents.
  This is the "STU-… ten years later" requirement made visible.
- Soft-delete stance confirmed: statuses only (`lifecycle_status`), hard delete remains
  a platform-level, PDPA-governed operation.
- **Tests:** search respects tenant isolation; alumni searchable; RLS keeps
  student/guardian out of the search endpoint.

**Exit:** principal types an old ID or a name; the student's full multi-year history
appears in under a second.

**Status: DONE** (2026-08-29). Exit criterion met and measured: a code search
returns in **4.6 ms p50** and the full history loads in **10.6 ms p50** on a seeded
school of 2,000 students × 4 years — end to end through the handlers, though
localhost, so the wire to Neon Singapore will dominate in the field.

**No history table.** `enrolments` has carried one row per student per academic year
since migration 003; R-6 reads it. Migration **044** adds exactly one object — an
index on `(tenant_id, student_id, academic_year_id)` — because `student_id` was the
last column of the only existing index that mentioned it, so one child's timeline
walked the whole school's history: 1.255 ms scanning 8,000 rows against **0.089 ms**
seeking four. The scan grows every January; the seek does not.

**No search engine.** The query is CLASSIFIED first (`STU-…`, a phone, a board
number, a name) so each shape gets the predicate its own existing index answers.
Every shape is under 12 ms end to end, so §15's condition for reaching for
Elasticsearch was never met. Measuring also showed `uq_users_tenant_phone` is a
PARTIAL index that PostgreSQL will not use unless the query carries
`deleted_at IS NULL` — 0.292 ms against 0.026 ms.

**Authorization supersedes one line above, deliberately.** The R-6 bullet said
"staff-gated" and "RLS keeps student/guardian out of the search endpoint". R-6's
brief asks in §13 and §18 for guardian and student access, scoped, so both endpoints
route through `app.can_see_student` — the predicate the RLS policies already use.
A guardian's search can only ever return their own children and a student's only
themselves, which the tests assert directly. A teacher still gets no global search.

The fee tab is **narrower than RLS**, the same pattern R-5 established:
`invoice_scope` reads `... OR can_see_student(student_id)`, so RLS alone would show
a class teacher every family's balance in their section.

Six tabs, not §4's eight: a transfer IS an enrolment row with `status =
'transferred'` and already appears in the timeline in the year it happened, and a
certificate is generated on demand by R-5 and never stored. Two empty tabs to match
a list would have been worse than saying so.

Full detail, the measurements and the four defects found, in the R-6 entry of
[PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md).

### R-7 — Onboarding & platform console

**Goal:** নতুন স্কুল যোগ করা = ঘণ্টার কাজ, দিনের না।

**Status: DONE** (2026-08-29), and **re-opened and closed again the same day**
by a completion pass — see the R-7 completion entry in
[PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md).

The specification below was built as written; the notes marked ▶ record where
reality corrected it. What the first pass did NOT do was walk the path
afterwards, and walking it found seven defects — three older than R-7. The
sharpest: the wizard asked for an "institution type" and offered a list of
teaching MEDIUMS, so a college onboarded through it was stored as a madrasah
and listed as one; and no real teacher could save attendance at all, because
the attendance screen carried a hardcoded `academicYearId: 'yr-2026'` that is
not a uuid. Both had been on screen the whole time.

> The runbook ([PILOT-ONBOARDING-RUNBOOK.md](PILOT-ONBOARDING-RUNBOOK.md)) stays
> as the manual fallback for a deployment where the platform console is not
> configured — and it was right that it came first: two of the three gaps R-7
> found are gaps the runbook would have hit at step 6.

▶ **Three things this phase discovered, none of them in the spec below.**
> 1. **Nothing had ever written `student_profiles`.** R-6 built
>    search-by-permanent-ID against `student_code` and no code path had ever
>    inserted a row. The student import now creates the profile and the code.
> 2. **`provision_tenant` leaves no subject template**, so a freshly
>    provisioned school rejected *every row* of its first student import.
>    `app.provision_curriculum()` (migration 045) closes it, deriving the
>    templates from the `class_subjects` provisioning already seeds.
> 3. **`student_cap` was never enforced anywhere** — declared in migration 001,
>    checked by nothing. It is now a statement-level trigger on `enrolments`
>    that states both numbers when it refuses.

▶ **BYPASSRLS was removed from `shikhon_platform`.** R-7.13 below says the
> runtime role cannot list or create tenants, and that holds; what it did not
> say is that the PLATFORM role should not be exempt from RLS either. It is
> not. The cross-tenant functions are SECURITY DEFINER and work regardless;
> everything else the console does is work inside one school under the ordinary
> policies. `assertRlsEnforced` therefore still guards platform-svc.

▶ **The onboarding state is derived, not stored** (R-7.14's recovery story).
> `app.tenant_onboarding_state()` counts the real rows, so an interrupted setup
> reports what actually landed rather than what a stage column believed.

#### R-7.1 Who creates a tenant, and the authorization chain

A tenant is created by the **platform operator** (us), never by a school and never
by a self-service signup form. There is no "create your school" button, and R-7
does not add one.

```text
Signed commercial agreement
        │
        ▼
Platform operator  ──authenticated as──▶  platform role (`super_admin`)
        │                                  + PLATFORM_API_KEY (second factor)
        ▼
platform-svc  ──SECURITY DEFINER──▶  app.create_tenant(...)
        │                             (the runtime role CANNOT do this,
        │                              and cannot even list tenants)
        ▼
audit.platform_access  ← every call, before and after, with the actor
```

Four properties this chain has to keep:

1. **The runtime role cannot create or enumerate tenants.** `shikhon_app` is
   confined by `tenant_self` (`id = app.current_tenant()`), so it can only ever see
   the one tenant it is already inside. Tenant creation therefore needs a
   `SECURITY DEFINER` function with a pinned `search_path`, granted to a platform
   role only — the same shape as `app.public_branding()` in migration 039.
2. **Two credentials, not one.** A platform JWT alone is not enough; the endpoint
   also requires `PLATFORM_API_KEY` from the environment. Creating a tenant is the
   single highest-blast-radius operation in the product, and a leaked session
   token should not be sufficient to perform it.
3. **Every call is audited before it acts.** `audit.platform_access` already
   exists (migration 001) for exactly this. The write goes in the same transaction,
   so an action that rolls back leaves no misleading audit row, and an audit row
   that exists means the action committed.
4. **Nobody inside a school can reach it.** `principal`, `school_owner` and
   `it_admin` are tenant-scoped roles; the platform console is a different service
   with a different role and a different key. A school compromised end to end still
   cannot create, read, or suspend another school.

This also retires the SMS worker's `SMS_WORKER_TENANT_IDS` env-var workaround,
which exists today only because no component could legitimately list tenants.

#### R-7.2 Institution information collected

| Field | Column | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bangla name | `tenants.name_bn` | ✅ | Primary name everywhere in the UI |
| English name | `tenants.name_en` | ✅ | Printed documents, `en` locale |
| Slug | `tenants.slug` | ✅ | Generated, see R-7.3 |
| Institution type | `tenants.stream` | ✅ | `bangla_medium` · `english_version` · `english_medium` · `madrasah` · `technical` |
| Level | `tenants.level` | ✅ | `primary` · `junior_secondary` · `secondary` · `higher_secondary` · `combined` |
| EIIN | `tenants.eiin` | ○ | 8 chars, **globally unique** — a typo here collides with a real school |
| MPO code | `tenants.mpo_code` | ○ | |
| Board | `tenants.board_code` | ○ | dhaka / rajshahi / madrasah / technical … |
| District, upazila | `tenants.district`, `.upazila` | ○ | |
| Address (Bangla) | `tenants.address_bn` | ○ | Seeds the branding letterhead |
| Weekend days | `tenants.weekend_days` | ✅ | Default `{5,6}` (Fri+Sat); **madrasahs are commonly `{5}`** |
| Shifts | `tenants.shifts` | ✅ | `{single}` default; `{morning,day}` etc. |
| Timezone / locale | `.timezone`, `.default_locale` | ✅ | Defaults `Asia/Dhaka`, `bn` |
| Plan, cap, trial end | `.plan_code`, `.student_cap`, `.trial_ends_on` | ✅ | See R-7.10 |

Institution type is **configuration, not a code path** (D4/D9): it selects
defaults for terminology, the academic template and the weekend, and nothing
branches on it.

#### R-7.3 Tenant id and slug generation

- **Tenant id** — `gen_random_uuid()`, database-assigned, never chosen by a human.
  It is the key the install link carries (`/app?tid=…`) and it is permanent.
- **Slug** — proposed by the wizard from the English name, then confirmed by the
  operator. Must satisfy the existing CHECK: `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{2,62}$`, and is
  `citext UNIQUE`.
  - Transliterate/lowercase, replace runs of non-alphanumerics with `-`, trim.
  - `Monipur High School` → `monipur-high-school`.
  - On collision, the wizard suggests a district suffix (`monipur-high-dhaka`)
    rather than a number: a school's slug becomes its subdomain (R-7.12), and
    `monipur-high-2` is a URL nobody will print on an admission slip.
  - **The slug is effectively permanent once printed.** Changing it later breaks
    every install link and QR code in circulation. The wizard says so at the point
    of choosing, not in a help page.

#### R-7.4 Branding setup

Reuses the **R-1 branding editor** unchanged (`#/branding`, `PUT /ops/branding`).
The wizard embeds it as a step rather than re-implementing it.

- Migration 039 already seeds `settings->'branding'` from `name_bn`, `name_en` and
  `address_bn`, so a school that skips this step still shows its own name, never
  the platform's.
- Uploading a logo is **optional** at onboarding and can be done later by the
  school's own IT admin — blocking activation on an asset the office has not found
  yet is how onboarding stalls for a week.
- The contrast warning from R-1 applies here too: a brand colour that cannot carry
  white text degrades every primary button at once.

#### R-7.5 Academic setup

One call, already built: `app.provision_tenant(tenant, year_label, year_start,
year_end, min_level, max_level)` (migration 012). It **must run inside the
tenant's own context** — it raises `42501` otherwise, which is the guard that
stops a mis-scoped session provisioning the wrong school.

It seeds, idempotently: academic year (marked current) → terms → **grading scale
and bands** → bell schedule per shift → classes for the level range → subjects and
`class_subjects` from the NCTB catalogue with mark distributions → fee heads →
chart of accounts.

> **The grading scale is not optional.** Without its bands,
> `app.compute_subject_grade` returns NULL and the first result publication of the
> year fails — months after onboarding, with no obvious cause. This is why
> academic setup is a wizard step and not a "you can do this later" link.

Sections are created after this step (the wizard offers "N sections per class",
or they arrive implicitly through the student import, which resolves a section by
name).

#### R-7.6 Teacher import

- CSV, same dry-run → digest → commit contract as students (R-7.7).
- Creates `users` rows (tenant-scoped) + `staff_profiles` with `employee_code`.
- Assigns the `subject_teacher` or `class_teacher` role.
- **Section and subject assignment is R-3's screen**, not the import: a teacher
  exists first, is assigned second, and the assignment is a dated record that can
  be ended and replaced without deleting history (master plan §2).
- A teacher with no phone number can still be imported; they activate by code
  (R-7.9).

#### R-7.7 Student import

Built and tested (F-1601): `POST /api/v1/academics/import`, roles
`principal` · `school_owner` · `academic_coordinator`.

**Contract:** validate → the server returns a `sha256` digest of the parsed rows →
commit re-sends the same file with that digest. A different file on the second
call is refused with `digest_mismatch`. Validation is stateless; there is no
staging table holding student PII between the two calls.

**Required columns** (aliases accepted, Bangla headers included):

| Field | Accepted headers |
|---|---|
| Roll | `roll_no` · `roll` · `রোল` |
| Name (Bangla) | `name_bn` · `name` · `নাম` |
| Class | `class` · `class_level` · `শ্রেণি` |
| Section | `section` · `শাখা` |
| Guardian phone | `guardian_phone` · `phone` · `মোবাইল` |

**Optional:** `name_en`, `gender`, `dob`, `birth_reg_no`, `religion`,
`optional_subject` (fourth subject), `guardian_name`, `relation`.

Partial import is permitted but the skipped count is stated on the button itself
("৭৬৮টি ঠিক সারি আমদানি করুন, ১৬টি বাদ") and recorded in `import_batches` — never
silent truncation.

#### R-7.8 Guardian linking

Guardians are created **from the student import**, not separately:

- `guardian_phone` is the identity. Two students sharing a phone become **one
  guardian with two children** — a `guardianships` row each. That is the common
  case (siblings) and getting it wrong produces duplicate SMS and a parent who
  cannot see one of their children.
- `is_primary` is set on the first link; `receives_sms` and `can_pay_fees` default
  on and are editable later.
- A guardian account is dormant until first login (OTP or activation code); the
  link exists from import.

#### R-7.9 Principal / IT admin creation

The **first account is the one the wizard must create**, because everything else
in the school is created by it.

- The operator supplies the head teacher's name and phone; the wizard creates the
  `users` row and grants `principal`.
- Login on day one is by **activation code**, not OTP: `POST /auth/activate`
  `{action:'issue'}`, issuable by `principal` · `school_owner` ·
  `academic_coordinator` · `class_teacher`. Single-use, 72-hour expiry, revocable,
  and the code itself is never stored — only an HMAC under `ACTIVATION_PEPPER`.
- This is what makes onboarding independent of the SMS aggregator contract (R-8).
  The school itself is the identity authority, face to face, which is the one
  thing a school is genuinely better at than a gateway.
- An `it_admin` account is optional and created the same way; in a small school
  the principal is both.

#### R-7.10 Plan, student cap, trial

| Column | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `plan_code` | Label only in R-7. No feature gating — `features jsonb` exists for that later. |
| `student_cap` | Checked at **enrolment and import**. Over-cap import is refused with the numbers stated ("cap 500, this file would make 540"), never truncated. |
| `trial_ends_on` | Banner in the app from 14 days out. Expiry does **not** delete or hide data; it moves the tenant to `suspended`. |
| `status` | `trial` → `active` → `suspended` → `archived` |

Billing the schools is **out of scope** for R-7 — invoicing is manual, and a
payments integration for our own subscriptions is a separate decision from the
MFS integration schools use for tuition.

> **Superseded from R-7 onward by D16 (2026-09-01).** The sentence above stays
> as the record of what R-7 decided and why, and it was right about the part it
> was about: we still integrate no payment gateway, and invoicing is still
> manual. What it got wrong was treating "no gateway" as "no commercial model".
>
> D16 makes the **commercial state** a first-class part of the Platform Console:
> plan, billing cycle, price, student cap, enabled modules, start and next-due
> dates, a manual payment record, and a lifecycle
> (`active → payment_due → grace_period → limited → suspended`) that is
> **derived from that record** rather than typed in. R-7.11's rule below —
> suspension is an access state, never a data operation — is unchanged and
> becomes load-bearing.
>
> The columns this needs mostly exist already: `plan_code`, `student_cap`,
> `trial_ends_on`, `status` and an unread `features jsonb`, all on `tenants`
> since migration 001. What does not exist is a payment record, a due date, or
> the three intermediate states — so `tenant_status` will need extending and a
> `platform.subscription` / `platform.payment` pair adding, under D8's rules.
>
> **Not now.** Implementation is **P7 (Platform Console)**. P2–P6 are UI phases
> and must not build it.

#### R-7.11 Suspension behaviour

Suspension is a commercial state, not a data operation. It must be reversible with
no loss, or it will not be used when it should be.

- **Login is refused** with a specific, non-alarming message naming the office to
  contact — never a generic auth error, which sends teachers to reset passwords
  that are not broken.
- **Data is untouched.** No deletion, no anonymisation, no export restriction.
- **Background work stops**: SMS dispatch and AI calls skip suspended tenants, so a
  suspended school cannot accrue cost.
- **`app.public_branding()` already excludes `archived`** — a school that has left
  stops appearing on any login screen. Suspended tenants still resolve, because
  they are expected to return.
- **Reactivation is a single status change** and needs no re-provisioning.

#### R-7.12 Tenant login URL and future subdomain provisioning

**Today (and after R-7):** the school's door is `/app?tid=<tenant-id>` — printed on
admission slips, sent in the school's own SMS, a QR on the office wall. The device
remembers it; the PWA install bakes it into `start_url`. The wizard's final screen
produces this link, a QR image, and a short Bangla instruction sheet the office can
print.

**Subdomain provisioning (R-7 scope):**

```text
monipur-high-school.shikhonbd.com
        │
        ├── wildcard DNS  *.shikhonbd.com
        ├── wildcard TLS certificate
        └── edge resolves hostname → slug → tenant
              (the slug is already unique; no new identifier)
```

`?tid=` links keep working unchanged — the two resolvers agree because they resolve
to the same tenant, and D12 forbids adding a third mechanism. Custom domains
(`portal.school.edu.bd`) are a later paid option, explicitly **not** an R-7 exit
criterion.

#### R-7.13 Security controls

| Control | Where |
|---|---|
| Tenant creation needs platform role **+** `PLATFORM_API_KEY` | platform-svc |
| `SECURITY DEFINER` with pinned `search_path` | `app.create_tenant`, mirroring migration 039 |
| Runtime role cannot list or create tenants | `tenant_self` policy, unchanged |
| Every platform action audited in the same transaction | `audit.platform_access` |
| Per-tenant PII key generated at creation | `tenants.dek_wrapped`, `blind_index_pepper` |
| Rate limiting on the console | existing `enforceRateLimit`, `service` class |
| Slug/EIIN uniqueness enforced by the database | `citext UNIQUE`, `varchar(8) UNIQUE` |
| Activation codes: HMAC-stored, single-use, 72 h | migration 037 |
| No self-service signup | by design — there is no public create endpoint |

#### R-7.14 Rollback and failure handling

Onboarding is a sequence of steps against a live database, so each step states
what happens when it fails:

| Step | Fails how | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Create tenant | Slug/EIIN collision | Wizard suggests an alternative; nothing was written (single transaction) |
| `provision_tenant` | Raises `42501` (wrong context) or partial | **Idempotent** — fix the context and re-run; `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` throughout |
| Branding | Validation error | Field-level message; the tenant is already usable unbranded |
| Teacher/student import | Row errors | Dry-run lists them with line numbers; downloadable error CSV; nothing written |
| Import commits wrong file | `digest_mismatch` | Refused before any write |
| Over cap | Refused with counts | Raise the cap or trim the file |
| Principal account | Phone already used in this tenant | Wizard offers to grant the role to the existing user instead of creating a duplicate |
| **Abandoned mid-way** | Tenant exists, half-configured | Set `status='archived'` — it disappears from login screens and can be deleted later under retention policy. **Never hard-delete a tenant with student rows** except through the PDPA erasure path |

A tenant created and abandoned is **not** an error state that needs cleanup
urgency: it is invisible to everyone but the operator.

#### R-7.15 Wizard specification, screen by screen

Nine screens. Each one states its fields, validation, what it depends on, and both
outcomes. The wizard is **resumable** — every step commits, so an operator can
stop after step 4 and finish tomorrow, and a browser crash loses nothing.

---

**Screen 1 — Institution identity**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Fields** | Bangla name*, English name*, institution type*, level*, EIIN, MPO code, board, district, upazila, address |
| **Validation** | Names non-empty, ≤120 chars. EIIN exactly 8 chars and globally unique — checked live, because the collision message must arrive before the operator moves on. Type and level from the enums. |
| **Depends on** | Nothing. First screen. |
| **Success** | Draft held client-side; nothing written yet. → Screen 2 |
| **Error** | Field-level messages. EIIN collision names the conflict as "already registered" **without naming the other school** — that would leak one customer to another. |

---

**Screen 2 — Slug and access**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Fields** | Slug (pre-filled from the English name, editable), weekend days*, shifts*, timezone, locale |
| **Validation** | Slug matches `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{2,62}$` and is free — live check. Weekend is a subset of 0–6; **the madrasah default is `{5}`, not `{5,6}`**, and the wizard pre-selects by institution type. At least one shift. |
| **Depends on** | Screen 1 (name seeds the slug; type seeds the weekend). |
| **Success** | → Screen 3 |
| **Error** | Taken slug offers a district-suffixed alternative, never a numeric one. A permanent, quiet warning sits under the field: *this becomes the school's web address and cannot be changed once printed.* |

---

**Screen 3 — Plan**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Fields** | `plan_code`, `student_cap`, `trial_ends_on`, initial `status` (`trial` \| `active`) |
| **Validation** | Cap > 0. Trial end in the future if status is `trial`. |
| **Depends on** | Screen 1–2. |
| **Success** | **The tenant row is written here** — one transaction, with the per-tenant PII key and blind-index pepper generated, and an `audit.platform_access` row. Everything after this point is resumable. → Screen 4 |
| **Error** | Any collision missed by the live checks surfaces here as a clean refusal; nothing partial is left. |

---

**Screen 4 — Branding** *(skippable)*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Fields** | The R-1 editor, unchanged: names, short name, logo, favicon, colours, address, phone, email, website, head teacher, signature, watermark |
| **Validation** | R-1's `parseBranding` — hex colours only, raster assets only, per-field byte caps. Contrast warning when white button text would fail AA. |
| **Depends on** | Screen 3 (a tenant must exist to own branding). |
| **Success** | Saved; live preview shows the shell and the printed letterhead. → Screen 5 |
| **Error** | Field-level. **Skipping is a first-class outcome**: migration 039's seed means the school already shows its own name. |

---

**Screen 5 — Academic year and structure**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Fields** | Year label (default: current year), start date*, end date*, lowest class*, highest class*, sections per class |
| **Validation** | End after start. Class range 1–12 and coherent with the level chosen on screen 1 — a `primary` institution asking for class 10 is queried, not silently accepted. |
| **Depends on** | Screen 3. |
| **Success** | Runs `app.provision_tenant()` **inside the tenant's context** and shows its returned table verbatim — *academic_year 1, terms 3, grading_bands 7, period_templates 2, classes 6, class_subject_mappings 54, fee_heads 5*. Seeing the counts is how an operator knows the grading scale exists. → Screen 6 |
| **Error** | `42501` means the session context was wrong — a bug, reported as such, not as user error. The function is idempotent, so retry is always safe. |

---

**Screen 6 — Head teacher account**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Fields** | Name (Bangla)*, name (English), phone (`+8801…`)*, email, role (`principal` default, `school_owner` optional) |
| **Validation** | BD phone format. Unique within this tenant — the same phone may legitimately exist in another school. |
| **Depends on** | Screen 3. |
| **Success** | User created, role granted, **an activation code issued and displayed once** with its 72-hour expiry. → Screen 7 |
| **Error** | Phone already in this tenant → offer to grant the role to the existing user rather than create a duplicate person. |

---

**Screen 7 — Teacher import** *(skippable)*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Fields** | CSV upload |
| **Validation** | Dry-run: required columns, phone format, duplicate employee codes. |
| **Depends on** | Screen 5 (classes must exist). |
| **Success** | Row counts, digest, commit. Section/subject assignment is deferred to R-3's screen and the wizard says so. → Screen 8 |
| **Error** | Per-row errors with line numbers; downloadable error CSV; the school fixes its spreadsheet and re-uploads. Nothing is written until commit. |

---

**Screen 8 — Student import** *(skippable)*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Fields** | CSV upload, target academic year (pre-filled) |
| **Validation** | The F-1601 contract: required columns present, roll unique per section, class/section resolvable, guardian phone valid. **Student cap checked against the whole file, not row by row.** |
| **Depends on** | Screen 5 (classes and sections must exist). |
| **Success** | Preview states imported and skipped counts on the button itself; guardians created and linked, siblings collapsed onto one guardian. → Screen 9 |
| **Error** | Per-row list + error CSV. `digest_mismatch` if a different file is committed. Over-cap refusal states both numbers. |

---

**Screen 9 — Review and activate**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Fields** | Read-only summary: institution, slug, plan, counts (classes, sections, teachers, students, guardians), branding preview, head teacher + activation code. Action: **Activate** (`status` → `active`). |
| **Validation** | Blocks activation only on the two things that break silently later: **no academic year** and **no grading bands**. Everything else (no logo, no students yet) is a warning, not a gate. |
| **Depends on** | All previous. |
| **Success** | Status `active`; produces the **login link** `/app?tid=…`, a QR code, and a printable Bangla instruction sheet for the office. Audited. |
| **Error** | A blocked gate links back to the screen that fixes it. The tenant stays `trial` and is fully usable by the operator meanwhile. |

---

**Tests (R-7):** provisioning end to end (new tenant → activation code → login →
take attendance, timed); suspension actually refuses login and stops SMS/AI;
`student_cap` refuses an over-cap import with both numbers; slug and EIIN
collisions refuse without leaking the other tenant; `provision_tenant` re-run is a
no-op; a tenant created and abandoned is invisible to every other tenant.

**Exit:** operator onboards a brand-new madrasa — different weekend, own branding —
without touching SQL, and the school's head teacher logs in from a printed code.

▶ **Met on the second pass, not the first.** The printed-code half was broken on any
deployment where OTP works: the activation door was rendered only when OTP was
switched off, so a principal holding the code the console had just issued had no
way to use it. The door is now always offered. The completion pass also onboarded a
**College** — a type the wizard could not previously express — and drove five roles
through to a saved attendance register.

▶ **Met, and measured.** মোহাম্মদপুর কলেজ (madrasah, weekend `{5}`, 34 subject
mappings) and মনিপুর উচ্চ বিদ্যালয় (school, `{5,6}`, 48) were both created
through the console against a real PostgreSQL — 208 ms and 249 ms of server
work — and the head teacher's activation code redeemed to a `principal`
session. Full detail in the R-7 entry of [PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md).

### R-8 — Go-live unlocks (credentials & production posture)

**Done 2026-08-29 — the code half. The contract half is open and stays open.**

This phase was written as "everything here is built and dark; contracts,
credentials, and switches". That held for the schema and NOT for the code:
**three things this list assumed were built and waiting for a credential did
not exist at all** — there was no provider interface to plug a token into,
nothing had ever received a delivery report, and the OTP endpoint logged the
code to the console instead of sending it. Adding credentials would have
changed nothing, and in the OTP case would have produced a login that silently
delivered nothing while the readiness screen reported it green. See
`docs/PHASE_LOG.md` § R-8.

- [x] SMS aggregator **adapter** + DLR webhook — `services/sms-svc/src/provider.ts`
      (`SmsProvider`, `StubProvider`, `SslWirelessProvider`) and
      `POST /api/v1/sms/dlr` with its own `SMS_DLR_SECRET`. `sendStub` is gone.
      Verified end to end against a fake aggregator; **the contract itself is
      still open** — see the unchecked item below.
- [x] Re-enable login — `OTP_SENDING_ENABLED` and the client's `LOGIN_DISABLED`
      are one environment variable now, not two constants edited in lockstep.
      The OTP is queued to `sms_outbox` in the challenge's own transaction.
- [x] Per-tenant AI budget enforcement — `app.consume_ai_budget()` reserves
      **before** the provider call; refusal is 402. This was the stated
      prerequisite for enabling AI broadly.
- [x] A readiness screen that reports which of these are actually configured —
      `GET /api/v1/platform/readiness`, rendered in the platform console.
- [ ] **SMS aggregator contract** (SSL Wireless / ADN / Robi). Commercial act;
      no code can close it. The adapter is ready for the credentials.
- [ ] Set `PII_MASTER_KEY_V1` (read `08-CREDENTIAL-ROTATION.md` §5 first — additive only).
      Reported as a blocking item on the readiness screen.
- [ ] Rotate the exposed `neondb_owner` password; revoke the stray MongoDB credential.
- [ ] `DATABASE_MAINTENANCE_URL` in Vercel env → nightly partition/purge cron goes live.
      Reported as a blocking item on the readiness screen.
- [ ] Run `migration-status.mjs` against production; apply the tail; **migration 023 is
      what unbreaks student-facing reads** — verify it is in force.
- [ ] MFS merchant credentials → per-provider initiation + signature verification.
      The `MFS_PAYMENTS_ENABLED` switch is live; no gateway was invented.
- [ ] `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. The budget gate it was waiting on is now built.
- [ ] Data-residency decision (Singapore → BD) **before real student PII lands**.
- [ ] Pilot: 3–5 institutions of different shapes (with/without groups, school+college,
      madrasah weekend config) per `05` Phase-1 exit criteria.
- [x] **Send safety before the first real batch** (2026-08-30): the composer states
      the audience size and total message count, a send above 200 messages needs an
      explicit acknowledgement that names the numbers, and `SMS_TEST_RECIPIENTS`
      restricts a deployment to an allowlist while still writing and showing every
      row that was withheld.
- [x] **Operational health per school** — `GET /platform/health` and the চলমান
      অবস্থা panel: queue depth, failures, last login, last attendance, push devices.
      Counts and timestamps only; no student PII.
- [ ] **Backups, restore test, RPO/RTO** — untested, no production database.
- [ ] **Monitoring and alerting** — not built. Cron-failure alerting is the minimum.
- See [12-PRODUCTION-RUNBOOK.md](12-PRODUCTION-RUNBOOK.md), whose first section is
  a table of what has and has not actually been exercised.

### R-9 — Post-roadmap add-ons (only after pilot stability)

**THE PILOT GATE IS NOT SATISFIED.** This phase says *only after pilot
stability* and the sequence table says *depends on: pilot*. No pilot has
happened. That gate stands for every item below.

**Web push was nonetheless implemented on 2026-08-29, in the pre-pilot period,
and is recorded as an independently implemented R-9 capability** — one that
needs no pilot feedback to design correctly, because what it does is carry a
message a school already sends, over a cheaper channel, with no change to who
receives it or what it says. Nothing about it is waiting to learn something
from a school. It is deployed dark (no VAPID keys) until an operator generates
a pair.

**The remaining six items stay behind the pilot gate**, and several of them are
exactly the ones a pilot would inform: whether section chat is wanted at all
and how it must be moderated, which reports a principal actually opens, whether
photo submission is worth the storage bill. Those are not questions to answer
from this side of a pilot.

- [x] **Web push notifications** — `047_web_push`, RFC 8291/8292 in
      `packages/server-core/src/web-push.ts`, a per-person screen at
      `#/notifications`, and a per-school opt-in that lets a delivered push
      cancel the same message's SMS. The only item on this list with **no
      external dependency**: VAPID keys are self-issued by
      `scripts/generate-vapid-keys.mjs`. Emergency notices and login codes are
      never suppressed.
- [ ] Section chat (moderated, section-scoped, teacher present). Marked
      optional by §2 and §3 of this plan; a child-safety design problem before
      it is a code one.
- [ ] Content authoring workspace (F-403). **Code-only and the last open P0** —
      every consumer of content is built and the producer is not.
- [ ] NCTB corpus ingestion (F-1301). **External**: the corpus itself, plus an
      embedding key.
- [ ] Photo/voice submissions (F-902). **External**: an R2/S3 credential. The
      metadata columns and the presign contract exist (`038_submission_media`);
      no object-storage client exists anywhere in the repo.
- [ ] Report trend charts (F-1505). Code-only. `class-perf-view` answers a
      different question — per-question class analysis, not a student's trend.
- [ ] Native app wrappers. **External**: Play/App Store accounts.
- [ ] Library / transport / hostel / payroll. Four new product areas; nothing
      exists.

## 5. Sequence & effort at a glance

| Phase | What | Relative size | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-0 | Hygiene | XS | — | **done** |
| R-1 | White-label branding | M | — | **done** (+ R-1-A surfaces) |
| R-2 | Notices + notifications | M–L | R-1 (branded shell) | **done 2026-08-29** |
| R-3 | Principal + IT portals | L | R-2 (dashboard cards) | **done 2026-08-29** (+ completion pass) |
| R-4 | Calendar UI | S | R-2 (notify hooks) | **done 2026-08-29** (+ R-4.1) |
| R-5 | Branded print engine | M | R-1 | **done 2026-08-29** (object storage + CSV export deferred) |
| R-6 | Search + history | S–M | — | **done 2026-08-29** (1 index; no history table, no search engine) |
| R-7 | Onboarding + platform console | M | R-1 | **done 2026-08-29** + completion pass same day (4 institution types, resumable wizard, staff activation codes, HSC subjects, attendance fixed; wildcard DNS/TLS is a deploy step) |
| R-8 | Go-live unlocks + production readiness | M | any | **OPEN — external-dependency mode (2026-08-30).** A repository-only cleanup audit the same day fixed a `tsc` gate that had been red since R-9 (10 errors, 3 of them real defects), pinned an unpinned CDN script on the marketing origin, corrected seven false "deployed" claims in the README, and unified three competing money formatters onto one. Repository-side work closed and accepted; every remaining gate needs a host, a domain, a contract, a device or a school. Checklist: `docs/12-PRODUCTION-RUNBOOK.md` §0a. No substitute may be built to make a gate green. Code closed 2026-08-30 (provider adapter + DLR, switches, AI budget, readiness screen, SMS send-safety, operator health panel, CORS allowlist, R-7 sharp edges, service-key hardening, alerting, preflight, restore drill, live security probe, onboarding measurement). **Every external gate is still shut**: no production deployment, no aggregator contract, no wildcard DNS/TLS, no real SMS or push delivery, no production restore, no alert delivered to a human, **no pilot institution**. Evidence is tracked per item in `docs/production-evidence.json`; `node scripts/preflight.mjs` is the gate and it exits non-zero |
| R-9 | Add-ons | — | **pilot — NOT satisfied** | web push implemented pre-pilot as an independent capability (2026-08-29); **the pilot gate stands for the other six items** |

Recommended execution order: **R-0 → R-1 → R-2 → R-3 → R-4 → R-5 → R-6 → R-7**, with
R-8 items flipped as credentials arrive.

**On the "onboarded in under one hour" target** (R-7/R-8): it is now *measured*
rather than asserted. `audit.platform_access` already timestamps every console
action, so the duration is derived from it — shown on the school's own page in
the console and aggregated by `scripts/pilot-report.mjs`. The target remains
**UNMEASURED** and must not be claimed: the only onboardings on record are
seeded fixtures and the author's own walks through the wizard, and the report
counts nothing that has not been explicitly designated a pilot. Each phase ends with a commit-tested,
deployable system and an update to `docs/07-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`.

## 5a. Phase status board (D17)

The single place that answers *"what state is every phase in, today"*. One
vocabulary, used exactly: **COMPLETE · PARTIAL · IN PROGRESS · BLOCKED ·
DEFERRED · NOT STARTED · SUPERSEDED · PLANNED**. Historical detail for every
row is in [PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md); the current snapshot of the repository
is [07-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md](07-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md).

Last reconciled **2026-09-08**, after **P10** — and the reconciliation found the board had stopped at P8 while P9 and P10 shipped, and had carried two contradictory P6 rows since 2026-09-02.

### Functional roadmap (R-series)

| Phase | Scope | Status | What is not done |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-0 | Hygiene | **COMPLETE** | — |
| R-1 | White-label branding (+ R-1-A surfaces) | **COMPLETE** | — |
| R-2 | Notices + notifications | **COMPLETE** | SMS fan-out reaches a stubbed aggregator — see R-8 |
| R-3 | Principal + IT admin portals | **COMPLETE** (backend + UI) | its **UI restyle** is P5, not done |
| R-4 | Calendar & schedule surfacing (+ R-4.1) | **COMPLETE** | — |
| R-5 | Branded print & document engine | **PARTIAL** | object storage stubbed → no stored PDF, print-first HTML only; CSV export **DEFERRED** |
| R-6 | Student history & global search | **PARTIAL** | one index, no history table, no search engine — adequate at pilot scale, unproven above it |
| R-7 | Onboarding & platform console | **COMPLETE** (backend + UI) | its UI and **D16** were completed in **P7** (2026-09-02). "Under one hour" is still **UNMEASURED** (`B-29`) |
| R-7.10 | "Billing the schools is out of scope" | **SUPERSEDED** by **D16** from R-7 onward | stands as written for R-7 itself |
| R-8 | Go-live unlocks & production posture | **IN PROGRESS — external-dependency mode** | real SMS aggregator, real push on a device, alert webhook, cross-tenant probe on production, an actual pilot. See [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) |
| R-9 | Post-roadmap add-ons | **PARTIAL** | web push shipped early as an independent capability; **section chat NOT STARTED** and gated on pilot stability |

### UI/UX roadmap (P-series, D14)

| Phase | Scope | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Ata Ekta token foundation | **COMPLETE** 2026-09-01 | `9e3f604` |
| P1 | Application shell, desktop + mobile, `/demo` split | **COMPLETE** 2026-09-01 | `0466861`, `2c4d68d`, `ab038e4` |
| P2 | Shared production component system (~30 components) | **COMPLETE** 2026-09-01 | `6145592`, `2e0a54b` |
| P3 | Teacher experience | **COMPLETE** 2026-09-01 | `5959975`, `d5100ee` |
| P3.1 | Stability gate | **COMPLETE** 2026-09-01 | `f62b8db` |
| P4 | Student + guardian experience | **COMPLETE** 2026-09-01 | `95c34bf` |
| — | **Pre-P5 Product Closure Pass** | **COMPLETE** 2026-09-01 | B-8 logout/cache privacy · B-15 student routine (migration 049) · B-6 class/section rename · permission-message polish. B-7 deferred with its design written |
| P5-0 | Stabilization gate before any UI work | **COMPLETE** 2026-09-01 | B-31 typecheck scope == CI, with a drift guard · B-30 one permission pattern across nine student views. Opened B-32, B-33 |
| P6 | Missing functional screen design | **COMPLETE** 2026-09-01 | 19 screens across four families on the design system · **14 defects**, two of them security (the teacher's AI generator and the answer-script upload offered to a student) · `emptyState`'s glyph never drew, and five screens had worked around it with a stray U+20DD · `.ui-card`'s `width: 100%` overflowed any card with a horizontal margin · **P5's flake reproduced, diagnosed and fenced** — fixed-uuid fixtures, one advisory lock in 26 suites · 29,942 element checks, 0 failures |
| P5 | Principal + IT admin final UI **+ B-7** | **COMPLETE** 2026-09-01 | P5-0 · **B-7 RESOLVED** (migration 050) · Principal dashboard · **B-34 RESOLVED**: every IT Admin and Principal screen on the design system, `results` and `inbox` recorded exceptions. Eleven defects fixed, five of them security or privacy — a ledger that fabricated accounts under a 403, three ungated finance endpoints in the public demo, a composer offered to students, `requireRole`'s English role codes reaching a Bangla screen. 19,812 element checks, 0 failures |
| P6 | ~~Screens that still need designing~~ | **SUPERSEDED — duplicate row, corrected 2026-09-08** | This row said **NOT STARTED** while the P6 row four lines above says **COMPLETE 2026-09-01** with its evidence. Two rows, one phase, opposite answers, in the file D17 designates as *"the single place that answers what state is every phase in, today"*. The COMPLETE row is the correct one — 19 screens, 14 defects, `f62b8db`→P6 evidence. Kept rather than deleted, per D10/D17: a phase record is never erased, and the fact that the board contradicted itself for six days is itself part of the record. |
| P7 | Platform Operations Center **+ D16 commercial controls** | **COMPLETE** (2026-09-02) | Plans, manual payments, a derived billing lifecycle, per-institution service control, role portals, student caps and the audit trail all have operator screens; **nothing commercial is SQL-only**. The phase's central finding was that suspension, portals and service switches were all **inert** — written, audited, and read by no application code — so most of P7 is enforcement (migrations 051–056), not restyling. §32 support mode is **deferred with its blocker named** (`B-38`) |
| P8 | Final legacy cleanup, consistency and release hardening | **COMPLETE** (2026-09-02) | The `--c-*` layer is **retained, with the reason recorded**: all 30 of its tokens are aliases of `--color-*` with 721 live usages, so it is one system with a compatibility layer rather than two competing systems, and "remove only confirmed zero-usage items" does not reach it. What P8 did remove is **491 lines of genuinely dead CSS** (123 classes no source, test, page or built bundle names), six dead exports and eleven duplicate helper copies. The phase also found seven LIVE defects while looking — chiefly that a calendar day was read as UTC at three of four layers (migrations 059/062 and 31 embedded-SQL sites), that a grace period could not be ended by the operator who set it (060), and that P7 left four schema-lint violations including two tenant tables without FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY (061) |
| P9 | Smart Routine — authoring, solving, publishing, eight audiences, print | **COMPLETE** (2026-09-07/08) | P9-0 … P9-9 plus the print-typography pass `1c55de4`. Print is measured in POINTS off a rasterised PDF (11.25pt subject / 10.25pt teacher / 12.5pt day header), one document page per A4 sheet on 28 documents. **B-115 remains NOT OBSERVED / EXTERNAL** — no sheet has come off a physical printer, and that is not claimed as passing |
| P10 | Platform operator ergonomics at scale | **COMPLETE** (2026-09-08) | `52be75a` … `b84c71f`. Fleet pagination/sort (migration 076), fleet-wide summary (077), attention-queue tuning (078), tenant identity writer (079), operator directory (080) closing **B-39**; the console's first 20 view tests, mutation-checked; `platform.css` 0 → 4 `@media` queries. Opened **B-117**, **B-118**, **B-119** |

**P5 opened with three items and two of them are now closed.** The Pre-P5
Product Closure Pass took `B-8` (logout and cache privacy, including the
question P4 deferred about a teacher's unsent attendance) and `B-15` (the
student routine, migration 049), and additionally closed `B-6` (class and
section rename) and the permission-message inconsistency.

**P5 now opens with `B-7` — guardian unlink** — which the closure pass audited
and deliberately did not force. `guardianships` has no way to express an ended
link, and adding one touches `app.my_ward_ids()` and `app.can_see_student()`,
which RLS policies across the schema depend on, plus 21 read sites including
the SMS and notice fan-out. The full design and blast radius are in
PHASE_LOG under "Pre-P5 Product Closure Pass". Then the principal and IT-admin
screens themselves.

### What is complete does not mean what is deployed

Every P-series phase above is **COMPLETE in the repository at `95c34bf`** and
**NOT DEPLOYED**. Production was cut from the 2026-08-31 tree (`0b6df00`, plus
`52d1609` which added `deploy/server.mjs`) by `git archive` — see PHASE_LOG,
"R-8 milestone". That **no deploy has run since is INFERRED**, from the absence
of any deployment entry after that date; it has not been re-observed on the
box. Nothing from P0–P4 is live. That distinction is what this table exists to
keep: on this project "merged" and "live" have never once been the same thing,
and a status board that blurs them is the specific way a reader concludes the
public site already has the new shell.

## 5b. Architecture drift — blueprint vs. as-built (D17b)

Disclosed rather than reconciled, because the reconciliation is a decision the
owner has not been asked for. Both descriptions are true of different things:
the blueprint describes what was designed, the as-built describes what serves
`https://sikhon.systems/` today.

| | Blueprint (D1, `06-DEPLOYMENT.md`) | As-built since 2026-08-31 (`52d1609`) |
|---|---|---|
| Hosting | Vercel Hobby, 11 serverless functions | **Hostinger KVM2 VPS** `voltix-prod`, Ubuntu 24.04, one Node process (`deploy/server.mjs`) under systemd |
| TLS / routing | Vercel edge | **Caddy**, already owning 80/443 for five sibling apps; one added site block |
| Database | **Neon** PostgreSQL 18.4, `ap-southeast-1`, PgBouncer transaction pooling | **`pgvector/pgvector:pg16` Docker container** `shikhon-postgres`, bound to `127.0.0.1:5433`, no shared cluster |
| Origin | `shikhon-lms.vercel.app` | `sikhon.systems` (Let's Encrypt, valid through 2026-11-29) |

**Why it changed.** R-8's largest open gate was "no production deployment",
and the owner already ran a VPS carrying five other applications. Adding a
container and one Caddy block was reachable in a day; a Vercel + Neon
production account was not.

**Security implications, stated.** The isolation posture is *better*, not
worse: the database is a dedicated container on loopback rather than a shared
cluster, no new superuser was created on the box that holds the sibling
applications, and the three-role rule (`shikhon_app` / `shikhon_platform` /
owner, none with `BYPASSRLS`) is asserted at boot exactly as before. Verified
on production: 48 migrations, 227 RLS policies, **0 tenants visible with no
tenant context**. What is *worse* is availability: one box, one process, no
regional failover, and a shared Caddy whose misconfiguration would take down
five other products. That risk is carried knowingly at a pre-pilot stage.

**Still stale, and known to be.** `D1` names "Neon Postgres";
`06-DEPLOYMENT.md` is titled "Deployment: Neon Postgres" and documents the
Neon pooler's `SET LOCAL` behaviour, which remains correct guidance for the
pooled case and is not what production runs. `12-PRODUCTION-RUNBOOK.md` §
staging still assumes a Neon branch. **These are not corrected here** — a
reader must not be told the blueprint was always the VPS. They are corrected
when the owner decides which of the two is the target architecture, and that
decision is tracked as **`B-27`** in [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) §7.

## 6. What NOT to do (binding, inherited + new)

- No per-school code paths, CSS files, or branches — configuration only (D4).
- **Never state or implement the branding rule as "ShikhonBD must disappear."** It is
  the permanent platform brand (D11). Strip it from a tenant's operational screens;
  leave it on the marketing site, the public docs and the platform console. A
  white-label sweep that reaches `landing.html` is a bug, and the CI guard treats it
  as one.
- Never close a phase without its [PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md) entry, and never edit an
  old entry to match a newer decision — supersede it with a new one (D10).
- No new framework, no rewrite of the PWA shell, no microservices split.
- Never delete assignment/enrolment/attendance history — end-date and supersede.
- Never trust frontend visibility as security — RLS is the enforcement layer.
- No social/chat features before R-9. (R-9 shipped web push and did NOT ship section chat; the moderation and child-safety design is still owed.)
- No Elasticsearch/Redis/queues until Postgres measurably fails at the job.
- Don't edit `api/v1/*.js` or `netlify/functions/*` bundles — sources live in `services/`.
- Don't touch `PII_MASTER_KEY_V1` rotation without `08` §5.


### UI integration — P1 complete (2026-09-01)

**P0** established the Ata Ekta token foundation (one file, `app.css`).
**P1** built the application shell: desktop sidebar + topbar, deliberate mobile
shell, role-aware navigation, `/demo` separated from `/app`. Commits `0466861`,
`2c4d68d` and the doc commit that follows them.

Remaining, in order: **P2** components (Card, StatCard, DataTable/MobileList,
Drawer, BottomSheet, FormField, states) · **P3** teacher screens · **P4**
student + guardian · **P5** principal + IT admin · **P6** the twelve screens
that need designing · **P7** platform console · **P8** retire `--c-*`.

Two findings from P1 belong to the product, not the migration:

- A tenant may pick a pale brand colour. Until P1 that put white on the brand
  fill in seventeen places at ratios as low as 1.95:1, and made the active
  sidebar row unreadable at 3.38:1. `brandingCssVars` now derives an accessible
  label colour and text step in the school's own hue.
- `generateVapidKeys` produced an unusable 31-byte private key 0.41% of the
  time. The pair is minted once per deployment, so an unlucky school would have
  had push permanently dead — which R-8's still-open "push on a real device"
  gate would have masked.


### UI integration — P2 complete (2026-09-01)

The shared component system exists (`apps/pwa/src/ui/`, commit `6145592`), so
P3–P6 build screens without inventing styles. Its gallery lives in
`apps/pwa/dev/` and is built on demand; it is gitignored out of `public/`
because everything there is deployed (D11).

Rendering it found five defects that had shipped, the oldest of them the
`width: 100%` on `.btn-primary` that has meant this product never had an
intrinsic-width primary button.

Next: **P3** teacher screens · P4 student + guardian · P5 principal + IT admin ·
P6 the screens that need designing · **P7** platform console **and D16's
commercial controls** · P8 retire `--c-*`.


### UI integration — P3 complete (2026-09-01)

The teacher surface is on the canonical system: dashboard, attendance, roster,
routine, marks, scripts. Before any P3 code, the ten commits carrying D14–D16
and P0–P2 were pushed to `origin/main`, which had been ten behind — the largest
risk the pre-P3 audit found.

Next: **P4** student + guardian · P5 principal + IT admin · P6 the screens that
need designing · P7 platform console **and D16's commercial controls** · P8
retire `--c-*`.


### UI integration — P4 complete (2026-09-01)

Student and guardian. The child selector — §3's CRITICAL piece — is a shared
component with three behaviours chosen by how many children there are, and it
never lets a parent wonder which one they are looking at: name and class in
the accessible name, the identity block on every screen, and the previous
child's numbers cleared *before* the next child's arrive (measured
synchronously, not asserted).

§21 is proven against real PostgreSQL rather than described: 11 tests, two
tenants, positive and negative — a guardian cannot reach a child who is not
theirs, and tenant A cannot reach tenant B's student even when given the id.

Three findings mattered more than the screens. The demo's staff gate held one
path where the product's `requireStaff` guards seven, so the public preview
showed a guardian a class register; a test now derives that list from the
services so it cannot drift again. Even with the gate closed the roster still
painted from the previous role's localStorage cache, so the demo's role picker
now purges. And `--c-primary-text` was derived against the brand-soft tint
only, leaving tenant B's active bottom-bar tab at 4.42:1 in dark mode on every
mobile screen — it is derived against both grounds now, with the invariant
tested.

Next: **P5** principal + IT admin · P6 the screens that need designing · P7
platform console **and D16's commercial controls** · P8 retire `--c-*`.

P5 opens with two items P4 identified and deliberately did not take: a
section-scoped routine endpoint (so a student can be told what class is next),
and what `doLogout` should do about the read-through caches on a shared device
when the sync outbox may hold unsent attendance.

---

## P-pilot-hardening (2026-09-02) — PARTIAL

The audit's six MUST-BEFORE-PILOT items. **M1** (deactivation) and **M6** (the
teacher register) are closed and proved. **M2** has a written, locally
rehearsed procedure and has not been run against production. **M3** turned out
to be answerable: there is **no wildcard DNS record** — `*.sikhon.systems` is
NXDOMAIN, verified against 8.8.8.8 rather than assumed — so the per-school
subdomain is a DNS and certificate task, not product work, and the `?tid=`
link the console already prints is what a pilot would use. **M4** and **M5**
remain blocked on an aggregator contract and a webhook destination
respectively; M5's pipeline is now proved end to end against a real listener.

Three defects were found that were on no list, all the shape this project
keeps meeting — a control that exists, is audited, returns success, and does
nothing. Guardian linking had been broken since migration 050; the substitute
finder's candidate query had never worked; and both survived because
`npm test` never ran the twenty-six SQL suites, CI ran only thirteen of them,
and CI's rollback step had never executed a single rollback file written since
049. All three are now directory loops that cannot drift.

Next: **P9 — Smart Routine Generator**, per the audit's §30. Not started, and
deliberately: the audit's exit condition for this phase was the MUST list, and
three of its six items need something only the owner can supply.

---

## Final Owner-Level SaaS Operations Audit (2026-09-02) — the roadmap it implies

Full report: [FINAL-OWNER-SAAS-OPERATIONS-AUDIT.md](FINAL-OWNER-SAAS-OPERATIONS-AUDIT.md).

The audit answered the owner's question — *can one operator run 10 → 500 institutions without
SQL?* — with a split verdict. **The platform-operations layer is sound**: the entitlement gate
is database-enforced, fails closed, refuses in Bangla, and was observed firing. **The product
layer beneath it is not**: four workflows a Bangladeshi institution must perform have no
writer anywhere in the product, so a school that onboards successfully can take attendance and
then do nothing else.

### Revised order of work

**P-writers (new, and first). COMPLETE 2026-09-03.** Exam creation · `fee_structures` ·
payment + receipt · routine + room creation. B-46 … B-49, all four closed, each with a real
UI and browser evidence:

| Writer | Backlog | Closed by |
|---|---|---|
| Rooms | `B-49a` | P0/A3 `9af6a9d`, migration 065 |
| Exam creation | `B-46` | P0/A1 `577162e`+`ccf7226`, migrations 066 + 068 |
| Fee structures | `B-47` | P0/A2 `62b6146`+`660afed`, migration 067 |
| Routine authoring | `B-49b` | P0/A4 `2e90d1b`+`2109141`, migration 069 |
| Payment + receipt | `B-48` | `ddbab64`+`cb34338`, migration 070 |

Each one was the same shape: a complete downstream and a missing top. Along the way the
audits found five things worse than the gaps — an exam bricked by publishing its own
timetable (`B-68`), a self-serve commercial upgrade (`B-71`), a deletable timetable
(`B-72`), a forgeable receipt (`B-77`), and a payment that could be applied with no
receipt at all (`B-78`).

**P-ops (small, alongside).** Schedule the crons on the production host; one non-ratio
heartbeat alert plus a webhook that reaches a person; the `rowCount` guard on the three
platform endpoints; close the service-disable sibling bypass; make tenant suspension revoke
sessions. B-50 … B-54.

*Revised in flight, 2026-09-03.* "Small" was wrong about one item. `B-53`'s
sibling bypass was three endpoints in the row and **six** on the running
stack, and the worst of them issued branded, printable fee receipts and report
cards for services a school had never bought. Following the same gate into the
SMS worker then found `B-83`: the dispatch run was opened with
`service: 'sms'`, and since `pilot` and `madrasa_basic` carry `push: true` and
no `sms` key, **no school on the pilot plan had ever received a push
notification** — silently, because a refused run reports a blocked tenant and
not a missing feature. Two unrelated defects fell out of the same audit
(`B-82`, a screen that 500'd on every request it had ever received; `B-86`, a
handler that discarded the cause of its own 500s). The scheduling half was
small; the entitlement half was not, and the estimate is corrected here rather
than in retrospect.

*P-ops closed, 2026-09-06.* A+B (`54610ce`) schedules and heartbeat; C
(`73ce8ec`) the entitlement leaks; D and E the deadman, the platform row-count
guard, the full state × surface matrix, suspension, and a fresh-tenant walk.
Closed on the way: `B-50` `B-51` `B-52` `B-53` `B-54` `B-82` `B-83` `B-84`
`B-86` `B-87` `B-88`, with `B-81` materially corrected and `B-80` classified
into a finance phase rather than absorbed. The closure patch finished `B-87`
(the staff ID is REQUIRED, matching the CSV importer, and a duplicate is now a
409 rather than the second 500 nobody had found) and **classified `B-55` as two
items**: `slug` is (B) intentional platform-only, refused by migration 069 with
its reason recorded; name/EIIN/district/upazila/address are (A) a normal
platform-admin need with no writer at all — reported per D13 as UI-pending, not
complete, and disclosed in the runbook. **One item remains BLOCKED and is
not counted as anything else**: the human alert needs a real
`ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` and a person confirming receipt — a configured transport
is not a human receipt. P9 has not been started.

**P9 — Smart Routine.** *In progress, PARTIAL as of 2026-09-06.* P9-0's
inventory found the solver, its six soft constraints, the three GiST clash
constraints and the §8.2 explainability all built — and eleven of `solve.ts`'s
inputs unreachable by any school. P9 is therefore the input path and the
screens over it, not a solver rewrite. P9-1 (teaching assignments) and
P9-2 (the setup wizard) are delivered end to end, and **no required solver
input is SQL-only any more** — bell times, subject demand and teacher
availability all gained institution-facing writers, with working days
deliberately left platform-owned and shown read-only.

P9-3 (generation) is delivered: one press produces a draft routine for every
shift the school runs, from the readiness gate the wizard displays, using the
existing solver unchanged. **Measured on five realistic institutions** —
20/40/80/120 sections across school, college and madrasa shapes — a
120-section two-shift college finishes at **6.4s p95** server-side. That is
LOCAL only: network, TLS and browser render are excluded, so the product's
one-minute promise is not yet proven end to end and is not claimed to be.

P9-4 (explainability) is delivered: every unplaced demand, conflict, warning
and unchecked rule arrives as a Bangla finding with its severity, its
evidence and — where the data supports one — a suggested fix. The solver's
single `no_free_slot` code became four categories (teacher, section,
availability, room) plus cross-shift, by recording which guard rejected each
candidate hour rather than by re-running anything. **No claim is made without
a counter behind it**, and no fix is suggested that the school's own data
cannot support.

Scoped re-solve, publish lifecycle, role outputs and print remain. Closed on
the way: `B-89` (a student could name themselves the teacher of any section),
`B-90` (the solver read closed assignments as live demand), `B-92` (a student
could rewrite the curriculum and block any teacher), `B-93` (a bell schedule
could contain overlapping periods), `B-94` (in a two-shift school the second
shift's solve could not see the first, producing routines that publish would
refuse, while the summary reported zero conflicts), `B-95` (the routine
authoring screens were stale-served by the service worker), `B-97` (the
solver's single `no_free_slot` code was four different problems with four
different fixes), `B-98` (the F-503 explainer reported a hard-conflict count
of zero as a constant — the same defect as B-94, in the other reader of the
same routines), `B-99` (raw room-capability codes reached the explainer
screen from rows stored months earlier), `B-100` (an 80-section school
produced 1,516 findings, close to a megabyte and a list nobody reads),
`B-101` (the explanation cost 38% of the run it explained), `B-102` (the
findings card claimed "no problems found" from an empty list) and `B-103`
(the generate response was five sixths data nothing drew — 375 kB down to
70 kB on a 120-section college). `B-91` records the mechanism behind the
RLS-scope family.

**P9-5 — routine editor, lock and undo.** *Delivered 2026-09-07.* The audit
found most of the editor already built — place, assign, move, remove, the
three clash sentences, draft/published separation — so P9-5 is four things.
The LOCK existed in the schema since migration 006, was enforced by `move`
and `remove`, and had no writer (`B-105`). UNDO is new: migration 074's
`routine_edit_log` records how to reverse each edit at the moment it is made,
bounded to twelve steps with no redo, and nothing may delete an entry.
CONCURRENCY: `row_version` had been incremented since A4 and checked by
nothing, so the second of two coordinators won silently (`B-106`). And
`hasUnsavedChanges()` existed on two views with nothing to call it (`B-107`),
which `ShellRoute.guardLeave` now does. Publish, scoped re-solve, role
outputs and print remain.

**P9-6 — scoped re-solve.** *Delivered 2026-09-07.* No second solver was
needed and none was written: `RmsSolver` tops up `periodsPerWeek −
alreadyPlaced`, so "recalculate this part" is "remove the affected slots and
run the solver you already have". The dependency closure is exactly the
selected set, because the solver only adds into free hours and cannot
displace a lesson that stayed. Pins survive by construction — they are never
in the removal set. `solve()` gained an optional `client` so the removal and
the re-solve are ONE transaction, which is what makes failure atomic and
makes PREVIEW possible: the real solver, rolled back. **Measured against full
generation: 9.6× / 9.5× / 21.5× / 48×** at 20 / 40 / 80 / 120 sections, with
the share of the week touched falling from 4.8% to 0.9%. One undo entry per
instruction (migration 075). Publish, role outputs and print remain.

**P9-7 — routine review and publish.** *Delivered 2026-09-07.* The brief's
starting point, `POST /api/v1/academics/publish`, publishes **exam results**
and answered `404 exam_not_found` for a routine id; the routine publish was a
button in the editor that published whatever was on screen without ever
saying what that was. Both are now exercised against the real database.
`routine_status` has carried `review` since migration 006 with **nothing ever
writing it** — the fourth control in P9 that existed, was enforced, and could
not be reached (after `section_subject_teachers`, the bell schedule and
`is_pinned`). DRAFT → REVIEW → PUBLISHED is now a lifecycle a coordinator and
a head can share, and a routine in review stays invisible to the school
(proved: 560 slots propagated, `app.student_day` returns 0 rows). One gate,
`src/publish-gate.ts`, both draws the review and enforces the publish, so the
screen cannot say "ready" about a routine the server would refuse — with a
test whose only job is that they never disagree. **§4's hard-conflict refusal
is now genuinely exercised**: a teacher double-booking is the one a draft can
hold, and the earlier probe's failure to plant one was recorded as NOT
exercised rather than as a pass. Removed an `unfilled` count that migration
006's CHECK constraint makes provably zero and that only `demo.ts` had ever
made non-zero. Publishing is **online only** and says why. The screen also cost more than
the 180 KB critical path had left, which forced `demo.ts` — 94.1 kB, 10.7%
of the bundle, downloaded by every school so they could never open it — out
into its own lazily-loaded bundle (`B-109`); app.js fell to 159 kB gzipped
with the limit unchanged. Role outputs and print remain.

**P9-9 — the printable routine.** *Delivered 2026-09-07.* A seventh document
type rather than a print system: R-5 had already built the letterhead, the
watermark, the signature, the escaping, `@page{size:A4}`, unbreakable table
rows and repeating headers, and an endpoint whose tenant "is never a
parameter". So `routine_sheet` joins `GET /api/v1/ops/document` and imports
`readTimetable` from rms-svc rather than re-deriving authorisation — one
authorisation path, so a printed sheet cannot show an hour the screen would
refuse, and `status = 'active'` makes "published only" true without a check.
No PDF library, no server renderer (§13). **Orientation follows content.** Also
fixed a gap in all seven documents: a school that had never opened the branding
screen printed the neutral "শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠান" placeholder instead of its own
name. Closes `B-112`.

*Redesigned and refined 2026-09-07, twice, on visual review.* The first pass
was printable and not readable, and **rasterising it is what proved it** —
headless Chrome and PyMuPDF, both already on the machine, nothing added to the
repo. Computed style said the page box was 297mm × 210mm and was right; the PDF
said every class page spilled onto a second and third sheet. That closed
`B-113` and `B-114` and found three defects nothing else would have:

- **A lesson was four lines**, so four sections were sixteen lines in a cell.
  It is now ONE line per section, keyed by a bordered chip carrying that
  section's tint. The room came off the dense sheet to buy the fit — measured
  at 11.2mm a section with it against 8.4mm without, which is one page against
  two — and remains on the section's, teacher's and room's own sheets.
- **The period ordinals were off by one all afternoon.** `period_no` is a
  POSITION in the school day and tiffin holds one, so `ordinalBn(period_no)`
  printed ৬ষ্ঠ over the hour a school calls ৫ম. The ordinal now counts TAUGHT
  hours, which is both the brief's ordinal system and the bug fixed.
- **Tiffin was invisible.** `period_kind` has seven values and migration 012
  seeds four; the read ended `AND pd.kind = 'teaching'` and discarded the rest.
  A break is now a band across the full width of the grid, ruled top and bottom.

The clock reads the way Bangladesh reads it — `দুপুর ১:৩০–২:১৫`, the part of
the day named once from the start — because `১৩:৩০` directly beneath a period
ordinal is read as a period number. A long section name is KEYED with a legend
carrying it in full, never truncated; there is no `text-overflow` or
`line-clamp` in this sheet's CSS and a test asserts their absence. Every tint
is near-neutral and is the FOURTH signal after the chip, its border and the
rule between lines, so the page survives a photocopier. **One document page is
one sheet of A4 on all 24 rasterised sheets**, and a 120-section college prints
60 class-grouped pages where the first pass printed 120 ungrouped ones.
`B-116` closed at the same time and was never a routine bug: `num()` has done
locale-aware digits since R-5 and FOUR builders — report card, admit card, ID
card, routine sheet — passed the year straight past it. Digits only, so a
school's `2026-27` session prints ২০২৬-২৭ and its words are never rewritten.

Browser acceptance is what closed the phase, and it found two things 2041
tests did not: the screen's clock was still 24-hour while the sheet printed
`সকাল ১০:০০`, and the accessible label still counted `period_no` — so a
screen-reader user heard "৬ নম্বর পিরিয়ড" for the hour everyone else called
৫ম. `B-115` remains **NOT OBSERVED / EXTERNAL**: the PDFs are real and
measured, but no sheet has come off a printer.

**P9-8 — role-specific routine outputs.** *Delivered 2026-09-07.* Eight
audiences, ONE dataset: institution, class, group, stream, section, teacher,
room and student are eight WHERE clauses over the routine whose `status =
'active'`, served by one endpoint in one shape. A test asserts that every
scope's lessons are a subset of the institution's, because the failure this
prevents is a teacher and a student reading different timetables for the same
hour. `status = 'active'` is the whole visibility rule and is applied once —
draft, review and B-108's `superseded` are excluded by it without being named.
Authorisation is per SCOPE and asks the database (`app.my_section_ids()`,
`app.my_ward_ids()`, `app.can_see_student()` — the functions the RLS policies
themselves use), so a teacher reads their own week without being an
administrator and cannot read the school's. The picker is the server's own
list, and an omitted scope is answered from it rather than from a default,
because a default is a second opinion about permission. A student sees only
the half of a split hour they attend; the section's grid keeps both. Found in
the browser and fixed: the response was shipping its own SQL predicate and a
bound uuid to the client, and the section count was being de-duplicated on
labels ('ক' in every class), which told a head their twenty-section school had
four. Print remains (`B-112`).

**B-108 — replacing a live routine.** *Closed 2026-09-07, after P9-7.* A
school that published once could not publish again. The solver booked against
every ACTIVE routine in the year, on a comment's assumption that the only
other one is the other SHIFT — so a school regenerating after publishing had
every teacher and room counted as taken by the timetable it was replacing
(560 placed in v1, **193** in v2). And even filled, the replacement could not
go live: `uq_routine_active` refused it, while `supersedes_id` and the
`superseded` status — both present since migration 006 — had never been
written by anything. The database was never the blocker and said so in its own
constraint comment. Fixed with a predicate that exempts the same shift's
predecessor (unique by `uq_routine_active`, derived from the schema, other
shifts still compete) and a publish that demotes then promotes in one
transaction. `/rms/generate` gained a baseline: clone the live routine, pins
included, or start fresh from academic inputs. **A replacement now places
exactly what a first generation places at every size measured**; the clone
path is 7.4×–11× faster. Also fixed `--font-bn-num`, declared in `app.css`
with its reason and referenced ZERO times, so every Bangla digit rendered in
Hind Siliguri — where ১ is close enough to ৮ that "১০:৪৫" reads as "৮০:৪৫".

**B-104 — cross-tenant client cache.** *Closed 2026-09-07, before P9-5.*
Found by P9-4's own browser acceptance and fixed as its own piece of work,
because tenant isolation is one of the six things that may interrupt the
roadmap. The service worker's data cache matched on URL alone, so one
school's cached answer was served to the next school on the same device —
and production addresses schools as `/app?tid=<uuid>` on ONE origin, so
browser origin partitioning did not separate them. RLS was never breached;
the client was. Fixed with tenant-aware cache keys (which make a cross-tenant
hit impossible to express) plus a purge on switch (which removes the leaving
school's data from the device), and proved with the server stopped: the
owning school still works offline, the other gets nothing rather than
somebody else's roster.

The original note stands as written:

**P9 — Smart Routine.** After P-writers, because P9 has four unmet prerequisites: no room
write path (0 rooms in 112 tenants), no routine-creation API, a Ramadan swap that
`uq_routine_active` structurally forbids, and a routine-editor query selecting a column
`rooms` does not have. Double-period placement, contrary to the earlier audit, is already
done.

**P10 — operator ergonomics at scale.** Pagination and sort on the fleet list; the attention
queue; the operator directory (B-39); rename/slug/contact editing. Trigger: the overview's
quadratic term must be fixed before ~50 real tenants.

*Scope re-derived from the repository 2026-09-08, before starting. Two corrections to the
line above as it was originally written:*

- **`/platform/health` in the ops drawer is DONE**, delivered by R-8 §10. `platform.ts`
  fetches `health?id=…` beside the tenant detail and renders `healthPanel()`; it is
  allowed to fail on its own so a health query cannot block an operator reading a school's
  setup. The audit note that "the ops console never calls it" predates R-8. It carries **no
  test**, which is the real remaining gap there.
- **The numbers have moved and are worse.** Measured on the 258-tenant development
  database rather than quoted from the audit:

  | fact | audit (111 tenants) | measured (258 tenants) |
  |---|---|---|
  | `app.platform_overview()` | 0.45 s | **0.68 s warm, 1.62 s cold** |
  | institutions flagged for attention | 103 of 110 (94%) | **247 of 258 (96%)** |
  | fleet list payload | — | **142 kB, unpaginated** |

  The attention queue's noise has ONE cause, and it is precise rather than a design
  failure: of 276 rows, **246 are `onboarding`**. The genuinely actionable kinds —
  suspended 5, overdue 21, cap_full 1, portal 2, service 1 — are 30 rows across ~11% of
  the fleet. Tuning one rule is the fix, not rebuilding the queue.

  `app.platform_overview()` is still migration 057's definition: five correlated
  subqueries per tenant (`enrolments`, `users`, `tenant_payments`, `user_sessions`,
  `product_events`) plus `CROSS JOIN LATERAL app.tenant_access(t.id)`. Nothing since
  replaces it.

*Also found while deriving scope, and NOT in the original line:* `apps/pwa/public/platform.css`
contains **zero `@media` queries**, so the console has no responsive treatment at all, while
row 22 of the UI-UX integration plan marks it as needing **both** widths. And `listTenants`
takes a search term but has no `limit`, `offset` or sort — the pagination gap is in the
service, not only the screen.

### P10 — DONE, 2026-09-08 (`52be75a` … `2a52a49`)

Everything in the line above shipped, and the two corrections held. Seven commits across
eight workstreams; the detail is in [PHASE_LOG.md](PHASE_LOG.md) under **P10**.

| what the line asked for | what shipped |
|---|---|
| pagination and sort on the fleet list | migration 076: `platform_fleet_ranked` / `platform_fleet` / `platform_fleet_summary`. One page, `count(*) OVER ()` for the filtered total, whitelisted ORDER BY, stable tiebreak. **142 kB → 15.1 kB** per request |
| the overview's quadratic term | gone from the console's load path; `app.platform_overview()` is no longer called to draw the dashboard |
| the attention queue | tuned at the rule, not rebuilt — 246 of 276 rows were `onboarding`, a kind that is not a thing to do today |
| the operator directory (B-39) | migration 080 + `authorize()` revocation gate. **B-39 RESOLVED** |
| rename / slug / contact editing | migration 079 `app.update_tenant_identity`, three-state optional fields. **`slug` deliberately excluded** — it is install-link infrastructure and changing it moves an installed PWA's entry point |
| `/platform/health` has no test | closed in P10-4 |
| `platform.css` has zero `@media` queries | four now; the table becomes cards below 1024px. Verified 360 → 1600 |

**The trigger in the line above — "before ~50 real tenants" — was met and passed.** The
console now reads the fleet instead of downloading it, and the cost that remains is linear
rather than quadratic — and the honest figure is worse than the first one measured. The
development database's 260 tenants are **241 leaked test fixtures** (B-119) with no students
or payments, and empty rows are cheap: 45 ms at 260, 307 ms at 2000. The **21 real** schools
in it cost about **0.5 ms each**, roughly 3× an empty row. Against real institutions that is
~150 ms of database time per console load at 100 schools and ~1.5 s at 1000. **B-118**, with
its trigger revised down to **300–500 real institutions**, and deliberately not pre-solved.
`OFFSET 250` costs the same as `OFFSET 0`.

Two gaps found in the *monitoring* rather than the product, both fixed: `migration-status.mjs`
did not know migrations 076–080 existed, and the security probe checked 1 platform route out
of 26. Both negative-tested; the probe is now 32 checks.

Opened by this phase and recorded rather than absorbed: **B-117** (no `apps/pwa` test file is
type-checked — measured at 113 errors to fix, which is not P10-sized) and **B-118**.

**P11 — portability.** Data export, which does not exist in any form today and is the
clearest customer-trust gap.

### P11 — DONE, 2026-09-08

Ten datasets plus an offboarding manifest, as **streamed CSV per dataset**. The contract
was decided from this repository rather than from preference: object storage is stubbed
(B-17), nothing here asked for an archive, and a CSV opens in the software a school office
runs. No storage dependency was introduced.

| dataset | service | dataset | service |
|---|---|---|---|
| students | academics | notices | ops |
| teachers | ops | audit | ops |
| guardians | ops | attendance | academics |
| structure | ops | results | academics |
| fees | finance | offboarding (manifest) | ops |

**B-11's export half and B-12 are closed by this.** Roles were narrowed, not widened:
principal / school owner / IT admin, plus the accountant for fees alone. Streaming is real
on Vercel and buffered on Netlify — the adapter joins written chunks at `end()` — and that
is written into the code rather than implied.

Security probe 32 → **38 checks**, six of them reading the export FILE rather than its
status code. That area was rewritten after it passed against a handler mutated to trust
`?tenantId=`, which turned a 1-row file into 2,000 rows of another school's students.

The pilot gates remain: the four writers, cron scheduling, an alert that reaches a human, the
SMS aggregator (external), and the 049 → 064 catch-up.

**There is no P12 in this plan, and that is deliberate rather than an omission.** The only
place the string appears in `docs/` is `FINAL-FULL-PROJECT-AUDIT-REPORT.md` §29 — *"P12 —
Post-pilot feature wave from §27, ordered by pilot feedback"* — and **B-5, a pilot
institution, is OPEN**. The candidate pool exists (§27); the thing that would order it does
not. Recorded 2026-09-08 by the P12 readiness audit.

**§29's numbering is NOT this plan's numbering,** which is worth knowing before reading it as
a roadmap. What shipped as **P10** is §29's proposed *P11* (the scale pass); what shipped as
**P11** is this plan's own portability line. §29's proposed **P10 — Identity & Guardian
polish** (§31 session/device list with revoke, §32 guardian visibility settings) was skipped
in the renumbering and has never shipped under any name. Its §31 half is confirmed absent in
code: `identity-svc` exposes `otp/request`, `otp/verify`, `refresh`, `logout`, `activate`
and nothing that lists or revokes a session.

## P0 — Core write paths (in progress, 2026-09-02)

The P-writers phase above, under way. One vocabulary, used exactly, and the
distinction this table exists to keep is **backend-complete** vs **a school
can do it**.

| Workstream | Backend | UI | Status | What is not done |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A1** exam creation | **COMPLETE** — `academics-svc/api/exams.ts`, migrations 066 + 068 | **COMPLETE** — `exams-view.ts` | **COMPLETE** 2026-09-02 | Browser-verified create · edit · duplicate-refusal · persistence · marks compatibility · routine compatibility · 26/26 role and cross-tenant checks · three viewports. The audit also found that publishing an exam ROUTINE wrote the RESULTS status and permanently bricked the exam (`B-68`), and that 066 had left `exam_marks` and `exam_results` writes on tenant-match alone (`B-67`); both fixed in migration 068. Ten further exam-domain defects are recorded OPEN as `B-70` |
| **A2** fee structures | **COMPLETE** — `finance-svc/api/feestructures.ts`, migration 067 | **COMPLETE** — `fee-structures-view.ts` | **COMPLETE** | Browser-verified create · edit · delete · duplicate-refusal · reload-persistence · cross-tenant · four roles. Payment capture is A3's, not this |
| **A3** rooms | **COMPLETE** — migration 065 | **COMPLETE** | **COMPLETE** | Regression re-verified 2026-09-02: Room A → visible → survives reload → Room B |
| **A4** routine authoring | **COMPLETE** — `rms-svc/api/editor.ts` gains create-routine/place/assign/remove, migration 069 | **COMPLETE** — `routine-editor-view.ts` | **COMPLETE** 2026-09-02 | Browser-verified create → place → edit → remove → publish, with all three clashes refused by name. Also found: `explainConflict` had never once run (the transaction was aborted, so every clash was a 500); the grid hard-coded the school week while one live tenant has a `{5}` weekend; and `tenants` had no role predicate, so **any account could upgrade its own plan** (`B-71`). Deferred to P9: the solver UI, double-period and parallel-block authoring, print |
| **B** production scheduling | NOT STARTED | — | **NOT STARTED** | — |
| **C** alerting + deadman | NOT STARTED | — | **NOT STARTED** | — |
| **D** entitlement bypasses | NOT STARTED | — | **NOT STARTED** | — |
| **E** fresh-tenant E2E | NOT STARTED | — | **NOT STARTED** | — |

**The recurring finding, now four for four.** Every writer this phase has
touched was missing beneath a complete downstream: `rooms` fed an empty
solver, `exams` fed a marks pipeline nothing could start, `fee_structures`
fed an invoice run that billed nothing. A2 added a variant — a control that
*did* run, was refused correctly by the database, and told nobody (`B-60`).
A1 added the sharpest one yet: a control that ran, succeeded, and destroyed
the feature it belonged to. Publishing an exam timetable — the ordinary act
it exists for — made that exam permanently unmarkable (`B-68`), and four
tests asserted that this was correct. "Backend complete" has not once meant
"a school can do it", and a green suite has not once meant "this works".

POINTS now: Chrome prints CSS at 96dpi so 1px = 0.75pt, and the sheet's
`11.5px` was **8.6pt** with the teacher at 7.9pt — 96% of a class sheet below
10pt, measured from the rendered PDF. Subject 11.25pt, teacher 10.25pt, clock
10.25pt, day header 12.5pt, and a test reads them off the shipped CSS. Two
consequences follow from the floor and both are arithmetic rather than taste:
**every sheet is landscape** (a portrait day column is ~30mm and holds a third
of a lesson at 11.25pt), and **a landscape A4 holds one section's week**, so
the booklet splits at section boundaries. The notice-board copy is a different
document, not the reading copy enlarged — it carries the subject alone, which
is why it can be larger at all.
