# 12 — Production runbook

What an operator needs when a real school is on the system: how the
environments are separated, what to do when something breaks, and which of
these procedures have actually been exercised.

Written during R-8. **Read §0 first** — a runbook whose reader believes more
has been tested than has been is worse than no runbook.

---

## 0. What has been exercised, and what has not

This is not a disclaimer. It is the most important section, because every
procedure below reads identically whether it has been rehearsed or merely
written down, and the difference matters at 08:00 on a Sunday.

| Procedure | State |
|---|---|
| Onboarding a school through the console | **Exercised.** Two institutions, end to end, no SQL — R-7 completion pass |
| Five-role login and attendance | **Exercised.** Same pass |
| Cross-tenant refusal | **Exercised.** Reads, writes, header and URL manipulation |
| Student-cap refusal and recovery | **Exercised.** Refused, nothing partial written, cap raised, import completed |
| SMS through a provider adapter | **Exercised against a FAKE aggregator** (localhost). No real aggregator has ever been called |
| Delivery reports | **Exercised against the fake aggregator** |
| Web push | **Exercised against a fake push service**, decrypted end to end. **Attempted against a real one on 2026-08-30 and blocked** — egress to FCM and Mozilla confirmed open, but the automated browser has notifications permanently denied and refuses to register a service worker it can otherwise fetch. Needs one ordinary browser on one real machine; see §4 |
| Backup and restore | **Rehearsed, not production.** `scripts/restore-drill.mjs` against a local Postgres 16.15: dump, restore into an isolated database, and every schema count, table count and per-tenant count compared — all identical. RTO 4.0s on 2.6 MB. **No production database exists to restore** |
| Live security probe | **Rehearsed, not production.** `scripts/security-probe.mjs` — 29 checks over 12 areas against a running deployment, positive and negative, none failing |
| Onboarding duration | **Instrumented, not measured.** The console now reports how long a school's setup took, derived from its own audit rows. No real institution has been onboarded, so the "under one hour" target remains unmeasured |
| Alert evaluation and delivery | **Exercised locally.** Every condition unit-tested at its boundary; the gather run against a real schema; a firing alert POSTed to a stand-in sink. **No alert has ever reached a human** |
| Service-key hardening | **Exercised.** Browser refusal, rotation slot, production default and the JWT fall-through, probed against the live endpoint |
| CORS origin allowlist | **Exercised in a browser.** Listed origin served, unlisted origin blocked by Chrome |
| The preflight itself | **Exercised.** `node scripts/preflight.mjs` runs and refuses to call this deployment ready |
| Production deployment | **LIVE (2026-08-31).** https://sikhon.systems on a Hostinger VPS, commit 52d1609, valid Let's Encrypt TLS. Browser-verified. See the R-8 external-milestone entry in PHASE_LOG |
| A pilot school | **None yet.** The platform is live but no institution has been onboarded |

Everything below marked ⚠ has never been run against production.

## 0a. External readiness checklist

R-8 is **OPEN** and in external-dependency mode. Everything on the repository
side is done; every box below needs something from outside it — a host, a
domain, a contract, a device, or a school.

**How to use this.** Tick a box only from **direct observation**, then record
it in [production-evidence.json](production-evidence.json) under the key named
in the last column. `null` = not attempted · `blocked` = attempted, the
environment prevented it · `pass` = observed. **Never tick from configuration
intent** — a configured provider is not a delivered message, and that
distinction is the reason this file exists.

`node scripts/preflight.mjs` is the machine half. It checks configuration and
refuses to call anything ready without the observation. It compares an
attestation's `environment` against the deployment being checked, so evidence
from a laptop cannot close a production gate.

### Production

- [ ] Production deployed
- [ ] Production commit verified *(the revision serving traffic, not the one you pushed)*
- [ ] Health check verified — `GET /api/v1/ops/monitor` returns 200 and `alerts: []`

> Blocked on: a hosting account. Nothing else here can start.
> Evidence key: *(none yet — the deployment is the prerequisite, not an item)*

### DNS / TLS

- [ ] Public domain — `shikhonbd.com` serves the marketing site
- [ ] Tenant domain — `/app?tid=<uuid>` works on it *(the fallback that must keep working)*
- [ ] TLS valid, no browser warning
- [ ] Wildcard DNS + TLS — `monipur.shikhonbd.com` loads, resolves to the right
      tenant, shows that school's branding, and leaks nothing of another's

> Set `WILDCARD_DNS_READY=true` **only after** a browser has loaded a tenant
> subdomain over HTTPS. The preflight refuses the flag without the attestation.
> Evidence keys: `wildcard_dns`, `wildcard_tls`, `subdomain_routing`

### SMS

- [ ] Provider contract signed, sender ID approved
- [ ] Credentials in the host's environment *(never the repository)*
- [ ] Test allowlist — `SMS_TEST_RECIPIENTS` set to 1–5 of your own numbers
- [ ] Real delivery to those numbers, with the provider's message id recorded
- [ ] DLR — a delivery report comes back and lands on the right row
- [ ] Failure and retry — a bad number fails cleanly and does not retry into a wall
- [ ] Cost and cap — segments counted, daily cap enforced, weekend/holiday
      suppression and the working-weekend override both observed

> **Set the allowlist before the first dispatch on a live aggregator.** Without
> it the first attendance run texts every real guardian.
> Evidence key: `real_sms_delivery`

### Push

- [ ] Real browser / device *(any ordinary Chrome, Edge or Firefox)*
- [ ] Permission granted — a person clicks Allow
- [ ] Subscription saved
- [ ] Real delivery — a published notice arrives
- [ ] Click-through opens the app on that notice
- [ ] Branding — the **school's** name on the notification, not shikhonBD (D11)
- [ ] Fallback — with push denied, unsupported or unconfigured, the message
      still goes by SMS
- [ ] Unsubscribe removes the device

> **The cheapest gate on this page.** No contract, no purchase, no deployment —
> one browser and one click. Attempted 2026-08-30 and **blocked**: egress to
> FCM and Mozilla is open, but the automated browser has notifications
> permanently denied and will not register a service worker it can otherwise
> fetch. Full sequence, including the negative cases, in §4.
> Evidence key: `real_push_delivery` *(currently `blocked`)*

### Backup

- [ ] Production backup configured, retention written down
- [ ] Isolated restore performed *(never over production)*
- [ ] Integrity verified — schema, tenants, students, teachers, guardians,
      attendance, results, finance
- [ ] RTO measured *(wall clock, decision to verified copy)*
- [ ] RPO decided *(a property of the backup schedule — no drill can measure it)*

> `scripts/restore-drill.mjs` does all of this and fails on any mismatch.
> Rehearsed on local Docker: RTO 4.0s on 2.6 MB. That is a rehearsal, not
> production evidence, and the preflight says so.
> Evidence keys: `backup_configured`, `restore_drill`

### Monitoring

- [ ] Alert destination configured — `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` (https)
- [ ] Real alert received by a human
- [ ] Cron-death detection documented and switched on *(§6 — the host's
      scheduled-function failure notification; the monitor cannot report its
      own death)*

> Evidence key: `alert_delivered`

### Offline

- [ ] Real connectivity loss *(a phone on mobile data, not a throttled profile
      and not "the server was stopped")*
- [ ] Offline attendance recorded, app stays usable across a reload
- [ ] Reconnect
- [ ] Sync completes
- [ ] No duplicates
- [ ] **Database verified from a second device** — check the server, not the
      phone. R-7 shipped a version where the whole batch was rejected and the
      only symptom was a small "১টি পাঠানো যায়নি"

> Full procedure in §8a. Evidence key: `pilot_offline`

### Pilot

- [ ] Pilot 1
- [ ] Pilot 2
- [ ] Pilot 3
- [ ] Pilot 4 *(optional)*
- [ ] Pilot 5 *(optional)*
- [ ] Onboarding times measured from **real operator workflows**
- [ ] Critical issues resolved

> Prefer variety — school, college, madrasa, different sizes, different
> weekends. Selection guidance and the evidence tables are in
> [PILOT-ONBOARDING-RUNBOOK.md](PILOT-ONBOARDING-RUNBOOK.md) §13–14.
> The "under one hour" target stays **UNMEASURED** until this section has real
> rows: `scripts/pilot-report.mjs` counts nothing that is not explicitly
> designated a pilot.
> Evidence key: `pilot_onboarding`

### The rule that governs all of the above

**Do not build a substitute to make a box green.** A fake aggregator, a stub
push service and a local restore are all useful for exercising code, and not
one of them is evidence for the boxes on this page. R-8 may stay OPEN for as
long as these prerequisites are genuinely unavailable; that is a correct state,
not a failure.

---

## 1. Environments

Three, and they are separated by **credentials, not by code**. There is one
codebase and one build; what differs is the environment a deployment is given.

| | Database | Platform console | SMS | Push | Domain |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Development** | local Docker `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` | `local-acceptance-key` | stub provider (logs) | fake service | `127.0.0.1:4174/4175` |
| **Staging** ⚠ | its own Neon branch | its own key | **allowlist**, see §3 | own VAPID pair | its own hostname |
| **Production** ⚠ | Neon main | its own key | real aggregator | own VAPID pair | `shikhonbd.com` |

### The separation rules

1. **No credential is in the repository.** `scripts/check-secrets.mjs --history`
   walks every commit and fails the build on credential material. It has been
   run on all 134 commits and reports clean.
2. **No secret reaches the browser.** The bundles are checked for every secret
   name; the only hit is the string `PLATFORM_API_KEY` as a *form label* on the
   operator sign-in screen. The operator types the key; it lives in memory for
   the session and is never persisted.
3. **A staging credential cannot reach production** because nothing in the
   repository names either. Both are supplied by the host's environment.
4. **The runtime role is not the owner.** `assertRlsEnforced` refuses to start
   if `DATABASE_URL` connects as a role with `BYPASSRLS`. Verified: neither
   `shikhon_app` nor `shikhon_platform` has `BYPASSRLS` or `SUPERUSER`.

### Preflight, before every deploy

```bash
node scripts/check-secrets.mjs --env
node scripts/preflight.mjs
```

`check-secrets --env` refuses a missing, placeholder or dangerously wrong
secret — an owner-role `DATABASE_URL`, a connection string with no `sslmode`, a
`PII_MASTER_KEY_V2` set without `V1` — and never prints a value.

`preflight.mjs` is the wider checklist: environment variables, secret strength
and distinctness, database separation and TLS, the maintenance and platform
roles, service-key posture, origins, bundles, the manifest and service worker,
cron ownership, SMS credentials and allowlist, VAPID keys, and every external
item. It prints one line per check with its evidence and exits

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | everything passes **and** every external item is attested |
| 1 | something FAILED — do not deploy |
| 2 | configuration is complete but something has never been demonstrated |

**Exit 2 is not success.** It is the state this deployment is in today, and it
stays that way until somebody records an outcome in
`docs/production-evidence.json` — with a date, an environment and a result.
That file is the human half of the preflight; the program checks whether the
configuration exists, and a person attests whether the thing actually happened.
Attestations lapse after 180 days, because "we restored a backup successfully"
stops being a fact about the current system fairly quickly.

Do not fill it in from intent. A null there is worth more than a confident
guess, and the whole reason this file exists is that R-8's first report could
have claimed SMS was ready on the strength of a configured provider.

---

## 2. Domain and tenant access

**What works today:** `/app?tid=<tenant-id>`. This is the address printed on
admission slips and baked into installed PWAs. It is not going away.

**What does not:** `monipur.shikhonbd.com`. R-7 shipped the hostname resolver
and it is unit-tested, but two **deployment** actions remain and neither is
code:

- point `*.shikhonbd.com` at the deployment (wildcard A/CNAME);
- issue a wildcard TLS certificate for it.

Until both are done, set nothing: `WILDCARD_DNS_READY` is unset, the go-live
screen reports subdomains as not ready, and the console shows a school's
subdomain marked **এখনো চালু হয়নি** with the install link presented as the
address to print. Set `WILDCARD_DNS_READY=true` only after a browser has
actually loaded a tenant subdomain over HTTPS.

---

## 3. SMS

### Turning it on, in order

1. Sign the aggregator contract and obtain a sender ID. **Not done.**
2. Set `SMS_PROVIDER=ssl_wireless`, `SMS_ENDPOINT`, `SMS_API_TOKEN`,
   `SMS_SENDER_ID`. Naming a provider without the other three **throws at
   startup** rather than falling back to the stub.
3. **Set `SMS_TEST_RECIPIENTS` first.** A comma-separated allowlist of E.164
   numbers belonging to your own team. While it is set, the dispatcher sends
   only to those numbers and marks every other queued row `suppressed` with
   `error_code = 'not_in_test_allowlist'`. The rows are still written and still
   visible, so a pilot can read exactly what *would* have gone out.
4. Run one real school day with the allowlist on. Read the console's চলমান
   অবস্থা panel and the suppressed rows.
5. Remove `SMS_TEST_RECIPIENTS` only when the messages, the sender ID and the
   audiences are all right.

### Safety already in the product

- The composer shows the **audience size and total message count** before
  sending, computed from the same resolver the publish path uses.
- Above **200 messages** the send button is disabled until the operator ticks
  a box that states the numbers.
- Changing the audience revokes that acknowledgement.
- Emergency notices and login codes are never suppressed by push.
- Per-tenant daily cap (`tenants.sms_daily_cap`, default 2000).
- Dedupe: one SMS per person per notice, per day, forever.
- Weekend and holiday suppression, with the R-4.1 working-weekend override.

### When SMS stops

| Symptom | Look at | Likely cause |
|---|---|---|
| Nothing sends at all | go-live screen → এসএমএস অ্যাগ্রিগেটর | `SMS_PROVIDER` unset — the stub is logging |
| Some recipients only | চলমান অবস্থা → ব্যর্থ / আটকানো | `SMS_TEST_RECIPIENTS` still set |
| Queue growing | চলমান অবস্থা → এসএমএস সারিতে | the cron is not running; check the host's scheduler |
| Individual failures | চলমান অবস্থা → সাম্প্রতিক কারণ | per-code; `INVALID_NUMBER` is data, `HTTP 4xx` is the contract |
| Sent but not delivered | `sms_outbox.delivered_at` | no DLR configured (`SMS_DLR_SECRET`), or the aggregator is not calling it |
| A school says it was texted twice | `sms_outbox.dedupe_key` | should be impossible; a genuine bug — capture the two row ids |

Five attempts, then the row is marked `failed`. There is **no exponential
backoff** — a known limitation.

---

## 4. Web push

`node scripts/generate-vapid-keys.mjs` once per deployment; set
`VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`. There is no vendor and no contract.

**Rotating the pair invalidates every existing subscription.** Devices recover
only when their owner next opens the app. Rotate on compromise, not on
schedule: the private key signs a 12-hour token addressed to a push service and
grants no access to anything of ours.

**Not verified against a real push service.** The RFC 8291 encryption is
checked against the specification's own published test vector, and the full
path has been driven end to end against a local push service that decrypted the
result — but FCM, Mozilla and Apple have never seen a message from this code,
and no real browser has completed a subscription handshake. The first contact
is most likely to fail on the `applicationServerKey` encoding.

### What was tried on 2026-08-30, and what stopped it

Worth recording, because it narrows the remaining work to one thing.

**Confirmed working:** real VAPID keys generate (P-256, 87-character public
key), and **network egress to the real push services is open** —
`fcm.googleapis.com` answered HTTP 400 and
`updates.push.services.mozilla.com` answered 406. Those are real responses from
the real services, not connection failures. The app is a secure context on
localhost, and `PushManager` / `ServiceWorker` / `Notification` are all present.

**What blocked it** was the automated browser, in two independent ways:
`Notification.permission` was already `denied` and `requestPermission()`
returned `denied` without prompting, so `subscribe({userVisibleOnly: true})` is
unreachable; and `serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')` failed with *"An unknown
error occurred when fetching the script"* **while the page itself fetched that
exact URL with HTTP 200, the right content-type, 5551 bytes of valid
JavaScript**. That second detail is the useful one: it means the service worker
is fine and the browser profile is not.

### Closing this gate

It needs a browser where a person can click Allow. Any ordinary Chrome, Edge or
Firefox on any real machine will do — no contract, no purchase, no deployment.

```bash
node scripts/generate-vapid-keys.mjs     # once; set both vars, then restart
```

Then, in that browser, against a deployment carrying the keys:

```text
open the app  →  Allow notifications  →  the notifications screen registers the device
              →  publish a notice from another account
              →  the notification appears
              →  click it: the app opens on that notice
              →  check the school's OWN name is on it, not shikhonBD (D11)
              →  unsubscribe, and confirm the device disappears
```

Then the negative cases, which matter as much: permission **denied** (the
screen must explain, not hang), an **unsupported** browser, **unconfigured**
VAPID (everything must still go by SMS), an **expired** subscription (the
service answers 410 and the row must be cleaned up), and a **failed** push
falling through to SMS.

Only after all of that: record `real_push_delivery` in
[production-evidence.json](production-evidence.json) with the browser, the
device and the observed result. Until then it stays `blocked`, and the
preflight will say so.

---

## 5. Backups and restore

**The drill exists and passes — against a local database.** That is a real
rehearsal and it is not a production restore:

```bash
DRILL_SOURCE_URL=…  DRILL_ADMIN_URL=…  DRILL_ENVIRONMENT=production \
  node scripts/restore-drill.mjs
```

It takes a backup, restores it into an **isolated** database (and refuses if
the target is the source), then compares the copy against the original: every
schema object count, every table count, and every tenant's students, teachers,
guardians, attendance, marks and invoices. Any difference is a failure, and it
says which.

That comparison is the whole thing. `pg_restore` exits 0 having skipped objects
it could not create; a dump taken with the wrong flags restores a schema with
no rows in it; a partitioned table can come back with its parent and none of
its children. Every one of those is a successful-looking restore and a database
that has lost a school's attendance.

**Observed on 2026-08-30, local Docker, Postgres 16.15:** 2.6 MB dumped in
0.6s, restored in 3.0s, 121 tables / 355 indexes / 227 RLS policies / 86
functions / 162 triggers / 4 attendance partitions and 27 table counts all
identical, 8 tenants identical per entity. **RTO 4.0s** — on 2.6 MB, which is
not a school year.

**Still not done:** the same drill against the production Neon project, which
is where the failure modes actually differ (branch-based restore, a managed
control plane, and a database large enough for the timing to mean something).

**RPO is not measurable by a drill.** It is a property of the backup SCHEDULE.
A drill that claimed to measure it would be measuring nothing.

**What Neon provides:** point-in-time restore within the retention window of
the plan, plus branch-based copies. Neither is configured, because there is no
project to configure.

**Before a pilot school's data lands, all of these must be true and none is
yet:**

- [ ] Automated backup confirmed enabled on the production Neon project, with
      the retention window written down here.
- [ ] **RPO and RTO decided and recorded.** A school's attendance register is
      the most time-sensitive: losing a day of it is losing a day of a legal
      record. A defensible starting point is RPO ≤ 1 hour, RTO ≤ 4 hours.
- [ ] A restore **performed**, into a staging branch, from a backup taken at
      least a day earlier.
- [ ] The restored copy verified by running `db/tests/invariants.sql` and
      `db/tests/schema_lint.sql` against it, and by opening one school in the
      console and confirming its counts.
- [ ] The wall-clock time of that restore recorded, because RTO is a
      measurement, not an intention.

**Restore procedure (untested, written from Neon's documented behaviour):**

1. Create a branch from the target timestamp in the Neon console.
2. Point a **staging** deployment at the branch. Never restore over production.
3. Run the two SQL suites above against it.
4. Compare one school's student and enrolment counts with what the school says.
5. Only then decide whether to promote the branch or copy specific rows.

---

## 6. Monitoring and alerting

A health dashboard is not monitoring. The console's চলমান অবস্থা panel is a
**pull** surface — somebody has to open it — and at 9pm on a Thursday nobody
does. So R-8 added a **push** half: `/api/v1/ops/monitor`, evaluated on a
schedule, delivering anything firing to `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`.

```
*/15 * * * *  ->  POST /api/v1/ops/monitor
                  -> gather platform-wide counts (owner role, counts only)
                  -> evaluate the conditions below
                  -> POST anything firing to ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL
                  -> and log it regardless, so the host's log drain is a
                     working fallback sink from the first deploy
```

`GET` evaluates and returns without delivering — use it to ask "what would
fire right now?" without paging anybody. Both require the service credential
and both refuse a browser.

### What it watches, and what to do

Most of these conditions detect an **absence**, not an error. Loud failures
look after themselves — somebody rings. The dangerous ones are the quiet ones,
where every screen is green and the messages simply stopped.

| Condition | Alert | Investigation path | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| No connection to the database | `database_unavailable` · **critical** | Neon console → the production project → Operations, for a compute suspend or a storage incident; then the host log for the failing query | Suspended compute wakes on the next connection — retry before escalating. If the endpoint moved, update `DATABASE_URL` and redeploy. **Tell schools that ring: attendance keeps working offline and queues; nothing is lost** |
| SMS queued > 0 and the oldest has waited ≥ 2h | `sms_queue_stalled` · **critical** | Did the dispatch cron run? Netlify → Functions → `cron-sms`, or the Vercel cron log. Then `GET /api/v1/platform/health?id=<tenant>` for per-tenant counts. A stalled head with no failures means the job never fired, not that sending broke | `POST /api/v1/sms/dispatch` by hand with the service key — idempotent per row. If the cron is dead, check `NETLIFY_CRONS_ENABLED` on the host that owns the schedule |
| ≥ 10 failures and > 25% of attempts (critical above 50%) | `sms_failure_rate` · warning → critical | `GET /api/v1/platform/health?id=<tenant>` lists the top error codes. One repeated code is the aggregator (credentials, balance, sender identity unapproved); a spread of codes is more likely bad numbers in one school's import | Aggregator: fix the credential or top up, then let the next dispatch retry the failed rows. Data: the numbers are wrong and the school must correct them — do not retry into a wall |
| Fewer than 1 month of attendance partitions ahead | `maintenance_cron_stopped` · **critical** | Netlify → Functions → `cron-maintenance`, or the Vercel cron log. `DATABASE_MAINTENANCE_URL` must be the **owner** role on the **direct** endpoint; a pooler URL fails here | `POST /api/v1/ops/maintenance` by hand, **today**. This cannot wait for the morning: when the month turns without a partition, every attendance and SMS write fails at once, for every school |
| > 50% of ≥ 5 push devices failing | `push_failure_rate` · warning | Almost always the VAPID keypair — a changed key invalidates every subscription at once, which is what a jump to near 100% means. Check `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` against what the PWA was built with | Nobody misses a message over this: an unaccepted push falls through to SMS, which is why it warns rather than pages. If the keypair changed, browsers resubscribe on their next visit once the key matches |
| ≥ 10 rejected sync ops and > 10% of the batch | `sync_rejection_rate` · **critical** | `sync_operations.conflict_detail` names the reason. R-7 shipped a version where every attendance push was rejected for a malformed academic-year id, and the only symptom a teacher saw was a small "১টি পাঠানো যায়নি" — assume the client is sending something the server will not take, not that teachers are wrong | The operations are still in each device's outbox and will be retried, so a server-side fix recovers them without anybody re-entering a register. Ship the fix, then **confirm the count falls** rather than assuming |
| ≥ 20 exhausted login codes and > 30% of those issued | `auth_anomaly` · warning | Compare the two numbers the alert carries. Many exhausted challenges across **few** phones is one person guessing at one account; across **many** phones it is an SMS delivery problem — people are not receiving the code they are typing. The second is far more common and needs the opposite response | Guessing: the per-phone limiter already refuses further attempts; watch. Delivery: check `sms_outbox` for the `auth.*` messages — this is the SMS alert wearing a different hat |

Thresholds live in `THRESHOLDS` in `packages/server-core/src/alerts.ts`, named
and commented rather than buried as literals, and each is tested at its
boundary. The first real pilot will move some of them.

### What this cannot see

**API failure rate.** There is no table of HTTP responses, and inventing one
would duplicate what the host already records for every invocation. That alert
belongs in the host's own metric alerting — Vercel Observability or Netlify
Analytics, on 5xx rate and function duration — and the monitor reports what
the database can see rather than pretending otherwise.

**Its own death.** A dead function does not report it. The host's
scheduled-function failure notification is what covers that, and it is part of
the monitor rather than hosting trivia: turn it on.

### Host metrics — where the rest lives  (R-8 §7)

Deliberately NOT rebuilt inside the product. The host already records every
invocation; a table of HTTP responses here would duplicate a source of truth
and be wrong in a different way from it.

| | Where it lives | Threshold | Who is told | How to investigate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **API failure rate** | Vercel → Observability → Functions (or Netlify → Functions → the log drain) | 5xx above 2% of invocations over 15 min | the same address as `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` | Group by route first. One route is a code path; every route is the database or an env var lost in a redeploy. Cross-check `GET /api/v1/ops/monitor`, which will already say if it is the database |
| **Function duration** | same panel | p95 above 3s on any route | same | Almost always a cold start against a suspended Neon compute, or a missing index after a migration. Compare against a warm invocation before assuming code |
| **Scheduled function failure** | Vercel → Crons, or Netlify → Functions → scheduled | any non-2xx, or a skipped run | same | This is the alert that catches the monitor's own death. If it fires alongside silence from `/ops/monitor`, assume the deployment, not the database |
| **Build / deploy failure** | the host's deploy notifications | any failed production deploy | same | A failed deploy leaves the previous revision serving, which is safe and silent — that is exactly why it needs an alert |

Two rules for whoever configures these:

1. **The destination must be the same one `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` points at.**
   Two alerting channels means one of them is the channel nobody reads.
2. **Turn the scheduled-function failure notification on before the first
   pilot.** It is the only thing in this document that can tell you the
   monitoring itself has stopped.

### NEVER DEMONSTRATED

No alert has reached a human. The sink is unconfigured, and until
`ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` is set and one alert is deliberately provoked and
received, `alert_delivered` in `docs/production-evidence.json` stays null and
the preflight reports monitoring as unverified.

## 6a. SERVICE_API_KEY — the widest credential

Presented as a bearer token to `/sync/push` or `/sync/pull` with an
`X-Tenant-ID`, this key makes the caller **any user of any school**. It is not
scoped to a tenant, does not expire, and no RLS policy constrains it — the
point of it is to choose the tenant context that RLS then enforces.

**Blast radius.** With this key alone, a holder can read and write every record
of every school on the deployment: rosters, attendance, marks, fees, guardians'
phone numbers. It is equivalent to the database password for the application
role. It belongs only in the host's encrypted environment store — never in the
repository, never in a browser bundle, never in a support ticket. **If it is
ever pasted into a chat, treat it as burned and rotate.**

**Why it still exists.** It is how an engineer replays a school's stuck sync
batch at 11pm, and how smoke tests reach a deployment before any human account
exists on it. Removing it would not make the product safer; it would make the
first production incident unrecoverable.

**What narrows it** (`packages/server-core/src/service-auth.ts`):

1. **Off in production.** Tenant switching is refused when `NODE_ENV=production`
   unless `SERVICE_KEY_TENANT_SWITCH=on`. Turn it on for the incident; turn it
   off after.
2. **Never from a browser.** A valid key arriving with `Origin`, `Cookie` or
   `Sec-Fetch-Site` is refused with `service_key_from_browser` and logged. That
   combination means the key has leaked into page code, and the refusal turns a
   silent leak into a dated log line. The check fires **only after the token
   matches**, so unauthenticated probes still get their 401.
   *`Sec-Fetch-Mode` is deliberately not a marker: Node's own `fetch` sends it,
   so treating it as one refused the scheduled SMS dispatch. Found by probing
   the endpoint, not by reading the code.*
3. **Loud.** Every acceptance and refusal emits one structured line carrying an
   8-hex fingerprint of the key, never the key. In production a legitimate use
   is rare, so these are an alerting signal.
4. **Constant-time comparison**, so a patient attacker learns nothing from
   timing.

**What it is not.** None of this touches an ordinary user. A logged-in
teacher's token is compared against the key, does not match, and the request
falls through to the JWT path — where tenant, user and role come from the
signature and `X-Tenant-ID` is never read. Verified against the live endpoint:
a teacher's token plus a forged tenant header returns that teacher's own
school, byte for byte.

### Rotation, without downtime

```
1. Generate a new key.
2. Set SERVICE_API_KEY_NEXT to it.        <- both keys now work
3. Move every caller to the new key.
4. Watch the logs: `keyLabel` says which slot each request matched.
   When nothing has matched "current" for a week, nothing uses the old key.
5. Promote - SERVICE_API_KEY = the new value; clear SERVICE_API_KEY_NEXT.
```

Without the second slot, rotating means a window where either the old key still
works or the ops scripts are broken — which in practice means it is never
rotated at all.

The same switch also gates the OTP debug echo (`X-Debug-Otp`), because echoing
a live login code is an account-takeover primitive and belongs behind exactly
the same door.

## 7. Support and recovery

| Situation | What to do |
|---|---|
| **Somebody cannot log in** | Issue a fresh activation code. Console → the school → সেটআপ চালিয়ে যান for an administrator; inside the school, ব্যবহারকারী → কোড for staff, or শিক্ষার্থী তালিকা → কোড for a student. Codes are single-use, 72 hours, and shown once |
| **Wrong person given a role** | The console refuses an existing phone number until the operator confirms, naming who they are and what they already are. If a role was granted in error, remove it from the school's own ব্যবহারকারী screen |
| **Account locked / too many attempts** | F-102 rate limiting is per phone and per IP, and it expires on its own. OTP is 3/hour per phone. Wait it out; there is no unlock button by design |
| **Import rejected every row** | Read the downloadable error CSV — line, roll, field, reason. The commonest causes are a missing fourth subject from class 9 up, and a class the school has not created |
| **Import refused for the cap** | The message names the cap and the current roll and says nothing was written. Console → প্ল্যান ও সীমা → raise it. The cap cannot be set below the current enrolment |
| **Provisioning stopped half-way** | Nothing is lost: every wizard step commits. Console → the school → সেটআপ চালিয়ে যান, which names the step that is actually missing. The readiness checklist counts real rows, not a stage column |
| **A school must be suspended** | Console → স্থগিত করুন. Reversible; data untouched; login refused |
| **A school is leaving** | Suspend, then archive. **Never hard-delete a tenant with student rows** except through the PDPA erasure path — historical records are the product |
| **Guardian says they got no SMS** | Check `sms_outbox` status for that recipient. `suppressed` + `not_in_test_allowlist` means the allowlist is on; `suppressed` + `delivered_by_push` means push carried it; `failed` carries the provider's code |
| **A notice went to the wrong audience** | It cannot be recalled from phones. The in-app receipts can be removed; the SMS cannot. This is why the composer states the audience and the count |

---

## 8. Pilot checklist

The full per-school procedure — choosing the institutions, what to have ready,
what usually goes wrong on each wizard step, and the evidence tables — is in
[PILOT-ONBOARDING-RUNBOOK.md](PILOT-ONBOARDING-RUNBOOK.md). What follows is the
short form.

Per school, before the first day:

- [ ] Onboarded through the console; no SQL used
- [ ] Institution type correct on the tenant list (বিদ্যালয় / কলেজ / মাদ্রাসা / স্কুল ও কলেজ)
- [ ] Classes 11–12 have subjects, if it is a college or combined (migration 048)
- [ ] Academic year, grading bands and at least one administrator — the three
      activation gates
- [ ] Principal and IT admin created, codes handed over in person
- [ ] Teachers imported; class teachers assigned to sections
- [ ] Students imported; guardian phone numbers checked
- [ ] Student cap above the actual roll, with headroom
- [ ] Branding: name, colour, head teacher's name
- [ ] `SMS_TEST_RECIPIENTS` still set, containing only your team
- [ ] Install link tested on a real phone on a real mobile connection
- [ ] Attendance taken by a real teacher, and it synced

### Subdomain activation, in order

Do not tick these from a DNS dashboard; tick them from a browser.

1. Wildcard A/CNAME for `*.shikhonbd.com` points at the deployment.
2. A wildcard TLS certificate covers it, and a browser shows no warning.
3. `https://monipur.shikhonbd.com` **loads the application**, not a 404 and not
   the marketing page.
4. The slug resolves to the right tenant — the school's own name and colour are
   on the login screen, not another school's and not the platform's.
5. A user of that school can log in there.
6. A user of *another* school cannot see anything of this one from that host.
7. `/app?tid=<tenant-id>` still works, because it is printed on admission slips
   and baked into installed PWAs. **It is not replaced by subdomains; it is
   joined by them.**

Only after 1–7 in a real browser: set `WILDCARD_DNS_READY=true` and record
`wildcard_dns`, `wildcard_tls` and `subdomain_routing` in
`docs/production-evidence.json`. The preflight refuses the flag without the
attestation, precisely so the console cannot promise an operator a subdomain
that does not resolve.

### What to record, per pilot school

Not a summary at the end — a row per school, written as it happens. Half of
these are numbers nobody can reconstruct afterwards.

| Field | Why |
|---|---|
| Onboarding start → end (wall clock) | The only honest source for "how long does onboarding take". R-7's figures were demo tenants and do not count |
| Operator assistance needed, per step | Names the screens that do not explain themselves |
| Every error message that was misread | A message that is technically correct and read wrongly is a defect |
| Import: rows offered, accepted, rejected, and why | Rejection reasons are the import format's real specification |
| First login — who, when, how long after handover | An activation code handed over and never used is the commonest silent failure |
| First attendance — who, when, and whether it synced | The product's actual job |
| Offline attendance — see §8a | The claim most at risk of being untrue |
| First notice, first SMS — audience, count, delivered | Cost and trust, together |
| First result, first invoice, first receipt | The three documents a school judges the product by |
| Search and history use, unprompted | What people reach for when nobody is watching |
| Every support contact, verbatim | The support log is the roadmap |

That list is what the R-9 pilot gate is actually waiting for.

---

## 8a. The offline test, exactly

At least one real institution must do this, on a real phone, on real mobile
data — not a throttled dev tools profile:

```
online -> open a section -> turn the connection OFF
       -> take the full register
       -> reload the page, and continue
       -> turn the connection ON
       -> wait for the sync indicator to settle
       -> a second person checks the server data from another device
```

Verify: every child's mark present, none duplicated, none silently dropped,
and the totals match what the teacher entered. **A rejected operation is not a
sync failure the teacher will see** — R-7 shipped a version where the whole
batch was rejected and the only symptom was a small "১টি পাঠানো যায়নি". So
check the server, not the phone.

Until this has happened at a real school, offline production-readiness is not
claimed anywhere: `pilot_offline` stays null and the preflight says so.

---

## 9. Deployment

See [06-DEPLOYMENT.md](06-DEPLOYMENT.md) for the database. For the application:

```bash
node scripts/build.mjs      # PWA + 11 API bundles, committed
npm test                    # 1090 tests
node scripts/check-secrets.mjs --env
```

Vercel and Netlify build from the same sources; `scripts/build.mjs` emits both
sets of function bundles. The Hobby plan caps a deployment at 12 serverless
functions and 11 are in use — one spare.

**Cron:** `vercel.json` schedules `/api/v1/sms/dispatch` and
`/api/v1/ops/maintenance` daily. Both are opt-in on the host and neither runs
in development.

---

## Update — P-pilot-hardening, 2026-09-02

### Current state of the two revisions

| | Repository | Production |
|---|---|---|
| Migration | **070** | **048** (unverified from outside — see below) |
| Landing page | `496199bd` | `496199bd` — **byte-identical, confirmed today** |
| `ops/staff-attendance` | present | **404** |

**The deployed revision could not be established from outside.** `platform/*`
answers 403 before route lookup, and no `ops/*` route is new enough to date
P7 or P8. Establishing it requires host access: `git log -1` on the VPS. Until
then, treat the migration number above as the last recorded value and not as
an observation.

### Before any deploy, read this

[13-MIGRATION-CATCHUP.md](13-MIGRATION-CATCHUP.md) — and its §0 first.
Migrations 049–063 **must not be left applied without 064**: 050 broke
`app.set_guardian_permissions` and 064 is the repair, so the whole range is
one unit of work. Production works today because it is on 048.

**065 · 066 · 067 are the P0 write-path migrations** and extend that unit
rather than standing apart. Each one adds the per-command RESTRICTIVE write
scopes a table never had, so applying the writer's code without its migration
leaves the table writable by **any role in the tenant** — the hole the
migration exists to close. 067 additionally adds
`uq_fee_structure_scope … NULLS NOT DISTINCT`; it was verified against zero
live violations before being written, but that check was run against the CI
database and **must be re-run against production before applying**:

```bash
docker exec -i shikhon-r5 psql -U shikhon_owner -d shikhon_lms -tAc "SELECT tenant_id, fee_head_id, academic_year_id, class_id, count(*) FROM fee_structures GROUP BY 1,2,3,4 HAVING count(*) > 1"
```

An empty result is the precondition. If it returns rows, the index will fail
to build and the duplicates must be reconciled by the school — **not deleted**,
since a fee structure is financial configuration a past invoice may reference.

**068 also REPAIRS DATA**, which none of the others do. It separates
`exams.routine_published_at` (the timetable was announced) from `status` /
`published_at` (the results are out); conflating them meant that publishing an
exam routine set the exam to `published`, after which no mark could ever be
entered and no result could ever be published. Before applying it, count how
many production exams are already in that state:

```bash
docker exec -i shikhon-r5 psql -U shikhon_owner -d shikhon_lms -tAc "SELECT count(*) FROM exams WHERE status = 'published' AND published_at IS NULL"
```

Every row that returns is an exam a school can no longer mark. 068 moves them
back to `planned` and records the routine announcement instead — that is a
repair, not a loss, but the count is worth recording before and after.

**069 changes no data and adds no column.** It replaces two `FOR ALL /
USING (true)` policies with per-command ones, adds write scopes to four tables
that had none, and adds a BEFORE UPDATE trigger on `tenants` refusing the
platform-owned columns from the application role. Before applying it, confirm
nothing school-side updates those columns in your deployment:

```bash
docker exec -i shikhon-r5 psql -U shikhon_owner -d shikhon_lms -tAc "SELECT count(*) FROM audit.activity_log WHERE action LIKE 'platform.%' AND occurred_at > now() - interval '30 days'"
```

The trigger is transparent to `app.create_tenant`, `set_tenant_status` and
`set_student_cap` (SECURITY DEFINER, so they run as the owner) and to the
platform console (its own database role). It WILL refuse
`UPDATE tenants SET plan_code` issued as the application role — which is the
point, and which required one test fixture to buy its plan at creation instead.

**070 changes no data and adds no column.** It gives `payment_receipts` and
`invoice_lines` per-command write scopes and adds `app.next_receipt_no()`. Before
applying it, check whether any tenant already has a payment applied with no
receipt — the defect it closes:

```bash
docker exec -i shikhon-r5 psql -U shikhon_owner -d shikhon_lms -tAc "SELECT count(*) FROM invoices i WHERE i.paid_amount > 0 AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM payment_receipts r WHERE r.invoice_id = i.id)"
```

Every row that returns is money a parent paid with no receipt to show for it.
070 does not repair those — the receipt number and method cannot be
reconstructed — so record the count and reconcile them by hand from
`mfs_transactions`.

Each has a rollback in `db/rollback/`. Rolling back 065–070 **re-opens the
write hole** rather than restoring a safe state; the rollback headers say so.
068's rollback additionally drops `routine_published_at` and re-points the two
routine guards at `status`, so `services/rms-svc/api/examroutine.ts` must be
reverted with it or routine publication will run neither the clash check nor
the invigilator check.

### Monitoring — what changed

`ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` is still unset, so `/ops/monitor` still logs into a file
nobody watches. What is new is that the delivery half has been **proved**:
`scripts/alert-rehearsal.mjs` runs the real endpoint against a genuinely
firing condition and a real HTTPS listener, 7/7. When the webhook is set, that
run is a repeat of something rehearsed rather than a first attempt.

To fire it by hand once the URL exists:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_API_KEY" \
  https://sikhon.systems/api/v1/ops/monitor
```

Then record `alert_delivered` in `production-evidence.json` with the time the
message arrived on a handset — not the time it was sent.

### One new log line worth watching

`[refresh] account_not_active` — M1 now refuses a deactivated account at the
refresh endpoint. A spike means somebody's account state is wrong, not that
the check is.

### Per-school subdomains

There is **no wildcard DNS record**. `*.sikhon.systems` is NXDOMAIN and
arbitrary labels do not resolve. Both product code paths exist and work; the
missing pieces are a wildcard A record and a DNS-01-validated certificate.
Recorded as `blocked` in `production-evidence.json` with what was tried.

## Update — P-ops, 2026-09-06

### The deadman, and what it can and cannot tell you

Migration 071 added `ops_job_runs`: one row per scheduled job, written by the
job itself through `app.record_job_run`. Three alert conditions read it, and
they are the only ones that can fire on a **totally idle** deployment.

| condition | fires when | means |
|---|---|---|
| `job_never_ran` | no row at all | the timers were never installed |
| `job_silent` | last success older than that job's own limit | the schedule stopped |
| `job_failing` | 3 consecutive failures | the schedule is fine, the work is not |

The limits are **per job** (`monitor` 90 min; `sms_dispatch` and `maintenance`
26 h), because one global threshold would either page every night on a healthy
daily job or miss a dead 15-minute one for a day.

**Business silence is not job silence.** A school that sent no SMS today is
normal — a holiday, a small school, a quiet week — and every ratio-shaped
alert correctly says nothing. A dispatcher that did not RUN is not normal, and
no ratio can see it, because the producer of the rows a ratio would read is
the thing that stopped. That is why these three measure the clock, never the
volume. Do not "fix" a noisy ratio by adding a floor; that is how B-51 was
created.

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
  https://sikhon.systems/api/v1/ops/monitor | jq '.signals.jobs'
```

`minutesSinceSuccess: null` means the job has never run **on this
deployment**, whatever `systemctl` says about the timer.

**What it cannot do.** The monitor cannot report its own death: `job_silent`
for the monitor is only evaluated *by* the monitor. If the monitor is what
stopped, nothing computes the alert. It fires on the first run back, so an
outage is never silently swallowed after the fact — but catching it *during*
needs a check from outside the box (an uptime monitor on a public endpoint, or
the host provider's alerting). This is unchanged from §7 and is deliberately
not simulated.

### Running the SQL suites without psql on PATH

`db/tests/*.sql` are the only tests that exercise RLS, the RESTRICTIVE write
scopes, the EXCLUDE constraints and the SECURITY DEFINER functions as
PostgreSQL actually enforces them. They were reporting `0 of 26 — NOTHING RAN`
on any machine without a local PostgreSQL client — which is most, because the
development database is a container that has psql inside it.

```bash
node scripts/sql-tests.mjs                    # all 26
node scripts/sql-tests.mjs invariants         # one, by name fragment
SQL_TEST_REPEAT=2 node scripts/sql-tests.mjs  # each suite twice
```

`scripts/test-all.mjs` uses this automatically when there is no local psql, so
CI (which has one) keeps its direct path. `PG_CONTAINER` overrides the
container name.

This is a real execution path, not a shim: `ON_ERROR_STOP` stays on, a raising
suite fails the run, and a file using `\i` or `\copy` is refused rather than
run with a path that cannot resolve from inside the container.

### Onboarding a school: what the product does, and what still needs psql

`services/platform-svc/test/fresh-tenant-e2e.test.ts` walks the whole road and
is the current answer. **24 steps run through the product's own API**, with no
direct INSERT:

> create → operations row → provision → **plan** → branding → principal → IT
> admin → activation + login → dashboard → structure → teacher → room →
> notice → calendar → academic year → sections → fee heads → fee structure →
> student import (preview, then commit) → roster → guardian → routine → exam

**Do not skip `POST /platform/plan`.** A new school defaults to `starter`,
which has no `finance` key at all, so its fee screens are correctly refused
until the plan it actually bought is set. A school onboarded without this step
silently has no fees module and the office will not know why.

Two steps still need psql, and the E2E asserts this list so it cannot grow
unnoticed:

1. **Renaming a school**, or fixing its slug, EIIN, district, upazila or
   address — no endpoint writes them after creation (`B-55`).
2. **Giving an UNPROVISIONED school its chart of accounts and fee heads.**
   `app.provision_tenant` seeds both inline (migration 012 §7 and §8), so a
   provisioned school has them; a school created through `POST /tenants` and
   never provisioned has neither, and nothing but `/provision` will supply
   them (`B-81`, revised — the earlier claim that the chart is *never* seeded
   was wrong).

Attendance is not on the list and is not a gap: registers are written through
the offline sync queue, because a teacher marks them on a phone in a room with
no signal.

### Suspension, arrears, and sessions

| operator action | what a signed-in user sees |
|---|---|
| `ops_state = suspended` | the **next request** 403s with `tenant_blocked`; refresh is refused too |
| `ops_state = limited` (arrears) | reads continue for services with `in_limited`; **sessions still renew** |
| back to `active` | service resumes immediately; no re-issue needed |

There is no revocation sweep and none is needed: every request asks
`app.tenant_access` on the connection it already holds, so a suspended school
stops being honoured immediately rather than being listed somewhere that can
go stale.

`limited` used to lock everyone out, because rotating a refresh token is a
write and the gate had set the transaction read-only — so every user was
signed out within one access-token lifetime with no way back in. Fixed
(`sessionWrite`, `B-54`), and worth knowing: if that ever regresses, the
symptom is "the whole school was logged out an hour after we marked them in
arrears", not an error anyone reports.

**A suspended school stays visible to the console** (`app.platform_operations`
is SECURITY DEFINER), which is how it gets un-suspended. If that regresses,
every suspension becomes permanent.

### Reading a 403 correctly

Four different refusals, and support should not treat them alike:

| `error` | means | remedy |
|---|---|---|
| `forbidden` | this ROLE may not | a different person in the school |
| `tenant_blocked` | the SCHOOL is suspended or in arrears | payment, or a call to us |
| `tenant_blocked` + `serviceState: not_in_plan` | never bought | change the plan |
| `tenant_blocked` + `serviceState: disabled` / `maintenance` | switched off | wait, or ask us |

The app now says which (`B-84`). If a school reports "it says we do not have
permission" for something they clearly should, check `serviceState` before
looking at roles.

### Adding staff, and the two identifier rules

A staff member's **employee code is supplied by the school** — it is their own
staff number and the CSV importer has always refused a file without it. It is
not generated, deliberately: a generated code would put a number in a school's
paperwork that the school never issued, and the same teacher would carry one
code if typed into the form and another if imported from the office's
spreadsheet.

| what support sees | what it means |
|---|---|
| 400, `field: employeeCode` | the staff ID box was left empty |
| 409, `duplicate_employee_code` | that staff ID is already used at this school |
| the same ID at another school | fine — the UNIQUE is per tenant |

A **student** code is the opposite and is generated (`STU-` plus eight hex of
the student's id), because a child does not arrive holding one.

### SQL-only today: correcting a school's identity (B-55)

Disclosed rather than left to be discovered. Two different situations:

**`slug` — platform-only on purpose.** Migration 069 refuses it from a school
account by name. It lives in the install link and the PWA `start_url`, so
changing it after launch moves every device's entry point. If it genuinely must
change, that is a platform operation with a device-relink plan, not a form.

**Name, EIIN, district, upazila, address — no writer at all.** There is no
endpoint and no screen. Correcting a school registered with a typo, or adding
an EIIN issued after onboarding, currently needs psql:

```bash
docker exec -i -e PGPASSWORD="$PGPASSWORD" "$PG_CONTAINER"   psql -U shikhon_owner -d "$PGDATABASE"   -c "UPDATE tenants SET name_bn = 'সঠিক নাম', eiin = '123456' WHERE slug = 'the-school'"
```

**A trap worth knowing.** The school's own branding screen writes a *display*
name into `settings->branding`, which is what appears on its documents and app
shell. So a school can look correct to itself while the operator console still
shows the typo. If a school says "we already fixed our name", check
`tenants.name_bn` and not only the branding.

## P12 audit — production readiness (2026-09-10)

**Ready:** six systemd units and a cron runbook in `deploy/`; a `readiness`
endpoint that reads no database and names no tenant; backup configured and a
restore drill recorded `verified`; 80 migrations; a reproducible build; and a
runtime floor in `scripts/test-all.mjs` that refuses a Node build carrying the
B-66 defect.

**Blocked, and external to this repository** — all four recorded `blocked` in
`docs/production-evidence.json`: wildcard DNS, wildcard TLS, subdomain routing,
and real push delivery. An SMS aggregator contract is also outstanding; the
provider abstraction is complete and throws loudly if a provider is named but
unconfigured, so a school can never believe messages are going out when they are
not.

**One gap to close:** migrations `038`, `076`, `077`, `078` and `079` have no
`.down.sql`. Rolling back a deploy that includes them is not possible by the
documented path.


---

## P13 — backup / restore runbook (2026-09-10)

### Restore drill — rehearsed and passing

```bash
DRILL_SOURCE_URL=<the database to back up> \
DRILL_ADMIN_URL=<a connection able to CREATE/DROP DATABASE> \
DRILL_TARGET_DB=shikhon_restore_drill \
DRILL_DOCKER=<container name, if pg_dump is not on PATH> \
  node scripts/restore-drill.mjs
```

Last run 2026-09-10 against the development database:

```
backup 5.1 MB (1.3s) → restore into an isolated database (4.0s)
7 schema counts and 27 table counts identical
16 tenants identical per entity
   (students · teachers · guardians · attendance · marks · invoices)
RTO observed: 5.9s          PASSED
```

**This is a rehearsal, not the production drill.** The script stamps
`environment: local-docker` on its own evidence block and says so. Production is
a managed host with branch-based restores and different failure modes; what a
local drill proves is that the procedure, the verification queries and the
pass/fail criteria all work — so the production run is a repeat of a rehearsed
thing rather than a first attempt during an incident.

**Re-run it against production once a backup schedule exists**, and paste the
evidence block it prints into `docs/production-evidence.json`.

### Why the drill compares rather than reports

`pg_restore` exits 0 having skipped objects it could not create; a dump taken
with the wrong flags restores a schema with no rows; a partitioned table can
come back with its parent and none of its children. Every one of those looks
like a successful restore and has lost a school's attendance. So the script
counts what went in, counts what came out, and treats any difference as a
failure — including a difference of zero rows where rows were expected.

### RPO is not measured here

RPO is a property of the backup **schedule**, not of any restore. The drill
declines to report it rather than inventing a number. **Setting that schedule is
an outstanding external action (P13-7).**

### Suspension never destroys data

Verified in P12 and unchanged: suspend → reactivate left every row identical
while enforced access moved `full → none → full`. A school behind on fees loses
access, never records.
