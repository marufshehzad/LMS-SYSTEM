/**
 * Writing to audit.activity_log.  (R-3, docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md)
 *
 * The table has existed since migration 001 and nothing has ever written to
 * it. R-3 is the phase that adds the mutations a school would later need to
 * account for — who assigned this teacher, who moved forty children into
 * another section, who promoted the school, who published these results, who
 * raised the SMS budget — so it is the phase that starts filling it.
 *
 * ── Audit failure must not fail the operation ───────────────────────────
 * Every call here is deliberately swallowed. If the audit insert fails, the
 * teacher is still assigned and the results are still published. The opposite
 * choice — letting a logging error roll back a real mutation — trades a
 * missing log line for a school that cannot promote its students, which is a
 * much worse day for everybody. What the log loses, the domain tables still
 * hold: the assignment history in `class_teacher_assignments`, the rollover in
 * `year_rollovers`, the publication in `exams.published_at`. The audit log is
 * the narration, not the record.
 *
 * That is a genuine trade and it is worth naming rather than discovering: a
 * silently missing audit row is invisible, so this is not a safe default for
 * a system where the log IS the record (a payment ledger, say). Here it is
 * not; `ledger_entries` is.
 *
 * ── It runs inside the caller's transaction and its tenant context ───────
 * `writeAudit` takes the same client the mutation used, so the row lands under
 * the same `SET LOCAL app.tenant_id` and the same RLS. There is no way to
 * write an audit row into another school's history, and none to write one
 * without a tenant.
 *
 * ── before/after are for the small diffs ────────────────────────────────
 * They exist so "replaced Rahim Sir with Karim Sir" can be reconstructed
 * without joining four tables. They are not a change-data-capture stream:
 * never put a roster, a mark sheet, or anything with a student's PII in them.
 * The log is readable by the school's management (041's activity_read_scope),
 * which is a wider audience than most individual records deserve.

 *
 * ── Why the SAVEPOINT, which looks like ceremony and is not ────────────────
 * "Never throws" was implemented as a bare `catch`, and inside a transaction
 * that is a trap rather than a safety net: PostgreSQL aborts the whole
 * transaction on ANY statement error, so swallowing the exception leaves the
 * caller running in a poisoned transaction whose COMMIT silently becomes a
 * ROLLBACK. The caller loses its own write and reports success.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. B-7's revocation endpoint passed a composite
 * string as `entityId`, `entity_id` is a `uuid` column, and the result was a
 * 200 response carrying a real timestamp for a revocation that had not
 * happened — no error anywhere, and the row untouched. Every other call site
 * in this repo has always had the same exposure.
 *
 * A SAVEPOINT scopes the damage to the audit INSERT: if it fails, only it is
 * rolled back and the caller's transaction is still good. The audit row is
 * lost, which is the documented trade-off; the operation is not, which was
 * always the intent.
