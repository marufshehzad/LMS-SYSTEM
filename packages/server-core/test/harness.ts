/**
 * Test harness for driving real serverless handlers  (F-106)
 *
 * The endpoints being backfilled (assignments, practice, next, results,
 * ledger) are almost entirely SQL. Testing them by re-implementing their
 * queries in the test would assert that two copies of a query agree, which
 * is worth nothing. So these helpers invoke the ACTUAL exported handler,
 * with a real signed JWT, against a real PostgreSQL with RLS live.
 *
 * A generated Ed25519 keypair is installed into the environment before any
 * handler is imported, so `authenticate()` and `verifyAccessToken()` run
 * unmodified — no auth stubbing, which means the tests also prove the
 * endpoints are actually gated.
