/**
 * R-1-A — three surfaces, three addresses.
 *
 *   /        the shikhonBD marketing site        index.html
 *   /app     the tenant management application   app.html
 *   /design  the Ata Ekta prototype              design.html
 *
 * Before this, "/" served the prototype and the real application was
 * reachable only by typing /index.legacy.html. These tests hold the split:
 * the routing tables of both hosts, the service worker's idea of which
 * navigation is the app, and the promise that a school's installed PWA
 * opens the application rather than a page selling it.
 *
 * The three HTML files are asserted by their CONTENT, not their names — a
 * rename that swapped two surfaces would keep the names plausible and
 * break everything, which is exactly the failure that produced R-1-A.
