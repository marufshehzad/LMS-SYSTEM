/**
 * Applying a tenant's identity to the running app.
 *
 * R-1 of docs/11-MASTER-PLAN.md. The rules live in
 * packages/ui-core/src/branding.ts; this is the thin browser layer that
 * fetches them, caches them, and writes them onto the document.
 *
 * ── Why branding is cached in localStorage ──────────────────────────────
 * The login screen is the FIRST thing a teacher sees, often on a 2G link
 * and sometimes with no link at all. Waiting on a network round-trip
 * before painting a school's name would put a blank or platform-branded
 * screen in front of them for as long as the network takes — which on the
 * reference device of docs/04 is exactly the moment the app feels broken.
 *
 * So: apply the cached branding synchronously, then revalidate in the
 * background and repaint if it changed. The same stale-while-revalidate
 * shape the service worker uses for reference data, done in the app
 * because it has to survive a cold start with no service worker yet.
 *
 * The cache is keyed by tenant. A device that signs into School A and
 * later School B must never paint B's login screen with A's logo, and a
 * single shared key would do exactly that.

 * BOOT whether a session-less visitor goes to the login screen or to demo
 * mode, and it cannot wait for a network round-trip to do it — that is the
 * whole argument branding.ts already makes about painting from cache on 2G.
 *
 * So the boot reads the cached answer and the fetch corrects it for next
 * time. An unvisited device has no cached value and reads it as OFF, which
 * is the reading that cannot strand anybody: it offers the activation-code
 * path, which works whether or not the aggregator does.
