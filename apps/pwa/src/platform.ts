/**
 * shikhonBD platform console — the operator's surface.  (R-7)
 *
 * Two screens and a wizard:
 *
 *     প্রতিষ্ঠান তালিকা  →  + নতুন প্রতিষ্ঠান  →  ৯ ধাপ  →  সক্রিয় করুন
 *
 * ── What this is not ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It is not the tenant application with an extra role. It is a separate page,
 * a separate bundle, a separate service, a separate database role and a
 * separate credential. A school compromised end to end reaches none of it,
 * and that separation is the point rather than a side effect: this is the one
 * surface that can see more than one school.
 *
 * It is also the one surface that keeps the shikhonBD brand (D11). Everything
 * under /app is white-labelled to the institution; here the operator needs to
 * know whose tool they are holding.
 *
 * ── Credentials, and why they are pasted ────────────────────────────────
 * The operator supplies a `super_admin` token and `PLATFORM_API_KEY`. Both
 * live in `sessionStorage`, not `localStorage`: a console left open on a
 * shared laptop should not survive the tab closing. The key is never baked
 * into this bundle — §24 — it is typed by the person, held for the session,
 * and sent as a header.
 *
 * Real operator SSO belongs with R-8's credential work; until then, two
 * pasted secrets is an honest posture for a tool used by a handful of people
 * who already hold the deployment's environment.
 *
 * ── The wizard commits as it goes ───────────────────────────────────────
 * R-7.15: every step commits, so an operator can stop after step 4 and finish
 * tomorrow, and a browser crash loses nothing. Screens 1–2 are held
 * client-side because nothing exists to hold them; from screen 3 the tenant
 * row exists and every later screen writes immediately. The progress the
 * console shows is READ BACK from the server (`app.tenant_onboarding_state`),
 * never remembered locally, so an interrupted setup reports what actually
 * landed rather than what this page thought it did.
