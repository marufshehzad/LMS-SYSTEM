 * §16 asks for a clear confirmation after every important mutation and warns
 * against "toast spam" in the same breath. Those pull in opposite directions
 * unless you separate two things that look alike:
 *
 *   **Inline confirmation** — stays on the screen it belongs to, next to the
 *   thing that changed. This is the default, and it is what `successNote()`
 *   in view-states.ts has done since R-3. A result published, a section
 *   created, a notice sent: the answer belongs beside the action.
 *
 *   **Toast** — for a mutation whose result is NOT on screen any more:
 *   attendance that synced ten minutes after it was saved, a queued SMS that
 *   went out. There is nowhere to put that message except over the top.
 *
 * A toast is therefore rare by construction, and one is on screen at a time:
 * `toast()` replaces whatever is showing rather than stacking, because a stack
 * of three notifications is a thing to dismiss rather than a thing to read.

 * right whenever the endpoint wrote a sentence for a person and wrong the
 * moment it did not. `requireRole` in server-core throws
 *
 *     "this endpoint requires one of: principal, school_owner, it_admin"
 *
 * so ANY 403 from ANY of those endpoints printed English role codes into a
 * Bangla UI — §14's "no cryptic backend messages in visible text", reached
 * through fifteen screens by one shared primitive.
 *
 * Fixing it at fifteen call sites is a list somebody forgets, so it is fixed
 * here: a server message is used only when it is actually addressed to a
 * person, and "addressed to a person" is decided by whether it is written in
 * the language the reader is reading.
 *
 * A 403 for a ROLE never uses the server's words at all, whatever language
 * they are in: what a refused person needs is what they may do next, and the
 * endpoint does not know that.
 *
 * ── The exception, and why it is not a hole in that rule ───────────────────
 * `HttpError`'s own comment says a blocked TENANT is not a refused role —
 * "a refused ROLE needs a different person, a blocked TENANT needs a payment
 * or a call to us — and the screen has to say which". The screen was not
 * saying which. Every entitlement refusal came out as "…দেখার অনুমতি আপনার
 * নেই। প্রয়োজন হলে প্রধান শিক্ষকের সাথে যোগাযোগ করুন", so a guardian at a
 * school with no finance module was told they were distrusted and sent to a
 * head teacher who would tell them the school does not use that part.
 * Observed in a browser against a running stack.
 *
 * For those two codes the endpoint DOES know what happens next, and it wrote
 * the sentence in Bangla for exactly this reader — so it is used. The Bangla
 * check still applies: a server that answered in English still gets the
 * generic sentence rather than printing a log line onto a parent's phone.
