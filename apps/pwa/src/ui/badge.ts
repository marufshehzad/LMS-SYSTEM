/**
 * Badges and status. (P2)
 *
 * There are two different things here that look alike and must not be merged:
 *
 *   **Badge** is a label. "৪র্থ শ্রেণি", "বিজ্ঞান", "CQ". It carries no state
 *   and no urgency, and it is decoration around text that is already there.
 *
 *   **StatusBadge** is a *value*. "প্রকাশিত", "বকেয়া", "স্থগিত". It is the
 *   answer to a question the reader is asking, and 04-UIUX §5 forbids
 *   answering it with colour alone — so every status carries a word, and the
 *   ones that mean trouble carry a glyph as well.
 *
 * The colour-alone rule is not theoretical here. A fee row that says "overdue"
 * only by being red is unreadable to a colour-blind guardian, invisible in the
 * printed receipt, and meaningless to a screen reader — three failures from
 * one shortcut.
